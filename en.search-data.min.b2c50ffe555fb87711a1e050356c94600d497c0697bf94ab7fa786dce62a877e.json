For instance:\n{ name: \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, age: 26, birthPlace: { name: \u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, zipcode: 50100 }, jobs: [ { employer: \u0026#34;Kolping\u0026#34;, start: 2021, end: 2022 }, { employer : \u0026#34;Eurac\u0026#34;, start: 2023 } ] } In JSON:\nan element can be either: a scalar (e.g. an integer), or an array of elements, or an object, an object is a finite set of key-value pairs, where keys are distinct, and each value is an element. Besides, a JSON element must have finite depth.\nEquivalently, a JSON object can be viewed as a function (with finite domain) that maps keys to JSON elements.\nObjects and programming languages # JSON objects do not exactly correspond to the objects that can be created in Java (and many other programming languages).

Identifying them may be essential to debug a program that does not terminate or runs out of memory (stack overflow, \u0026hellip;).\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/project/sections/free_project/","title":"Option 1: free project","section":"Project","content":" Option 1: free project # The first possible type of group projects is for students to develop a Java application of their choice.\nThis application is only a prototype, so it does not need a comprehensive list of features or functionalities.\nThe evaluation of the project will be mostly based on its backend (rather than the frontend). This means that the application:\ndoes not need a graphical user interface (but may have one), should perform non-trivial backend task(s) (e.g. writing and/or reading to/from files is not sufficient). Guidelines # Motivation # A good projects is driven by an idea.\nFeel free to design your application so that it matches your own interests. For instance:\nrelate it to a hobby (music, cinema, fashion, sport, games, social media, astronomy, etc.), use the project as an opportunity to explore a topic that you are curious about (natural language processing, computer vision, recommender systems, robotics, etc.), develop a functionality that one of your favorite applications is missing. Do not hesitate to be ambitious at first. You can restrict the scope of your project (to certain features or components) later on.\nSpecification # A frequent source of failure for this course is students focusing on tools (e.g. following tutorials) without having a precise objective. The short deadline (June 2025) does not give you this flexibility. Besides, without a precise objective, the amount of libraries that are available to you (especially in Java) can be overwhelming.\nSo we recommend you to clarify what your application should do, before thinking about how you could implement it. In other words, specify which problem(s) (i.e. input and expected output) your program and/or components should solve. Then only think about algorithms, libraries, tools and/or tutorials that can help you solve these problems.\nIn order to determine whether your specification is precise enough, you may check whether it leaves some doubt as to whether an output is correct or not.\nUser interface # Developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) requires familiarity with a graphical framework. Learning the details of such a framework (terminology, syntax, setup, etc.) can be an important time investment, and this knowledge may not transfer to other graphical frameworks. In other words, developing a GUI may not require lot of thinking, but a lot of reading (and web browsing).\nBeware also that GUIs technologies are still rapidly evolving, and that recent innovation has largely been driven by web development. So learning a graphical framework for Java may not be a strategic investment of your time (compared to learning a Javascript framework like React or Angular). Note that even desktop and mobile applications are increasingly relying on web technologies for their GUIs (thanks to frameworks like Electron or React Native).\nThis is why we recommend you to think carefully before committing to a Java GUI, and to keep it minimal if you do. Note also that we will not evaluate your project based on aesthetic criteria.\nSo in order to design your interface, you may follow the following guidelines:\nAsk yourself whether your application really needs a GUI. A command-line interface (CLI) may be sufficient, because: your program takes files as input and produces files as output, or your program is (primarily) meant to be used by other programs (rather than human beings), or your program is meant to be used by other developers, or external programs with GUIs (such as IDEs) can easily call your application, or you leave the GUI for future work (again, your application is just a prototype), etc. If you really need a GUI, then: decouple frontend and backend (whenever possible), so that the backend could be used with another frontend, and conversely. Example. Many applications accessible via GUI have a natural decoupling of frontend and backend. For instance, consider an application that allows booking hotel rooms. The backend takes as input some data (e.g. number or guests, duration, etc.), and outputs data as well (available rooms, prices, etc.). These input and output are independent of the aspect or structure of the GUI (windows, menus, buttons, fields, etc.).\nExample. Even for some games, frontend and backend can easily be decoupled. Consider for instance a program that plays chess against a human opponent. The backend:\nkeeps track of the current state of the board, takes as input either a move from the white player, or a request to play as the (bot) black player, outputs the next state of the board. These input and output do not depend on a specific GUI (they can for instance be encoded using algebraic notation). So the backend can be implemented without any reference to graphical elements or controller inputs (mouse clicks, etc.).\ndevelop the backend first (and write unit tests for it),\ndevelop the frontend afterwards (if you have time for it).\nIf you really need a GUI, then try to keep it minimal. In particular, restrict the input to what is essential for your application (the more freedom the user is given, the more likely he/she is to input a sequence of actions that your program cannot handle). Illustrations # Here are some examples of (past and imaginary) possible projects:\na program that detects texts generated by a large language model, a program that takes as input a dataset of Tweets and identifies communities and/or influencers based on the network formed by re-tweets, a program that retrieves news articles about an input topic (using web APIs), and analyses their polarity (via sentiment analysis) together with their provenance (news outlet, country, etc.), a (toy) recommender system, a program that generates (solvable) sudoku grids with different sizes and/or level of difficulty, a game to help people improve their typing speed, a web crawler that retrieves sport-related statistics from various websites and exposes them via a web API, a classroom reservation system for the Unibz that can computes a default schedule for a whole semester, satisfying a set of constraints (room capacity, etc.) and/or preferences (minimize days of presence per week of a same group, etc.), a flashcard app that incorporates answers produced by a chatbot, an (Obsidian-like) note management application, a program to organize and manage coding contests (similar to this one), a password manager (with encryption), for instance similar to pass, where password update and synchronization are performed via git, a program that analyzes the commit and/or branching history of a git repository (e.g. contributions of the different users, frequency of commits, percentage of preserved code, etc.).

A possible class for these two objects may enforce this structure, and it could be named City. An object that follows this blueprint is called an instance of this class.\nDeclaration # In a typed language (like Java), a class must specify not only the \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo; of its instances, but also their types. For instance, the class City could be declared as follows in Java:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; ... } In Java, a class is often declared in a dedicated file. This file must have the same name as the class (e.g. City.java in this example).\nThe three variables (name, zipCode and region) are called attributes (or sometimes member variables).\nConstructor # A class also needs a special method called a constructor.\nThe constructor is in charge of creating a (fresh) instance of the class.\nNote. A class may have several constructors (with different signatures).\nWriting a constructor in Java # The constructor of a Java class must have the same name as the class.\nFor instance:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; public City(String n, int z, String r){ name = n; zipCode = z; region = r; } ... } Note. In this example, the variable names n, z and r are not very explicit. However, using name, zipCode and region would be ambiguous (because these names are already used for the attributes of the class). In Java, we can use the prefix this. to refer to attribute names, thus eliminating the ambiguity.\nFor instance:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; public City(String name, int zipCode, String region){ this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipcode; this.region = region; } ... } Calling a constructor in Java # A Java constructor is called with the keyword new. For instance:\nCity myCity = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100, \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34;); City yourCity = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100, \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34;); Warning. In Java (as in Python, C#, etc.), the constructor does not return the instance itself, but a reference (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo;) to this instance.\nNote. The object that is created in memory contains extra information, in particular a reference to its class. This allows type checking, casts, etc. (more on this later).\nAccessing an object in Java # The attributes of an object can be accessed like regular variables, using ., followed by the name of the attribute. For instance,\nCity thatCity = new City(\u0026#34;Siena\u0026#34;, 53100, \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Wrong region: \u0026#34; + thatCity.region); thatCity.region = \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34;; System.out.println(\u0026#34;Better now: \u0026#34; + thatCity.region); will output\nWrong region: Lazio Better now: Tuscany Reference type vs primitive type # Recall that a Java constructor returns a reference to the object that it creates. So in the examples above, the value of each variable (myCity, yourCity and thatCity) is a reference, not the object itself.\nThis also holds for variable with an array type (like int[] myArray).\nThe types of these variables (e.g. City or int[]) are called reference types.\nSyntax. In Java, types that start with a capital letter (like City or Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;) are usually reference types.\nTypes that are not references types (like int or char) are called primitive types.\nIn Java, the value of a reference cannot be output (printed, displayed, etc.) by a program (as opposed to C/C++ for instance). But this value can be overwritten or compared to another.\nExercise What is the output of the following program?\nCity aCity = new City(\u0026#34;Matera\u0026#34;, 75100, \u0026#34;Basilicata\u0026#34;); City theSameCity = new City(\u0026#34;Matera\u0026#34;, 75100, \u0026#34;Basilicata\u0026#34;); System.out.println(aCity == theSameCity); System.out.println(aCity.zipCode == theSameCity.zipCode); Solution false true Exercise What is the output of the following program?\nCity anotherCity = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100, \u0026#34;Emilia-Romagna\u0026#34;); City yetAnotherCity = new City(\u0026#34;Mantua\u0026#34;, 46100, \u0026#34;Emilia-Romagna\u0026#34;); yetAnotherCity.name = anotherCity.name; System.out.println(yetAnotherCity.name); anotherCity = yetAnotherCity; System.out.println(anotherCity.zipCode); System.out.println(anotherCity == yetAnotherCity); Solution Exercise 2.\n\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34; 46100 true Passing by value or by reference # Programming languages differ in the way arguments are passed to methods. Two common strategies are:\npassing by value: the method receives as input a copy of each argument, passing by reference: the method receives as input a reference to each argument (which allows the method to modify the initial argument). Consider for instance the following program (in pseudocode):\nint myInteger = 0 myMethod(myInteger) print(myInteger) void myMethod(int argument){ argument += 1 } If the argument is passed by value, then the program will print 0. If the argument is passed by reference, then the program will print 1. Java passes by value # In Java (and many other programming languages, like C, Python, Javascript, etc.), arguments are passed by value. So the above program translated in Java will print 0.\nWarning. Consider a method with a reference type argument. Because Java passes by value, this method will receive a copy of this argument. But this is a copy of the reference, not a copy of the object itself.\nExercise What does the following Java program print?\nint myInteger = 0; City myFirstCity = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100, \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34;); City mySecondCity = new City(\u0026#34;Mantua\u0026#34;, 46100, \u0026#34;Emilia-Romagna\u0026#34;); myMethod(myInteger, myFirstCity, mySecondCity); System.out.println(myInteger); System.out.println(myFirstCity.zipCode); System.out.println(mySecondCity.zipCode); public void myMethod(int integer, City firstCity, City secondCity){ integer += 1; System.out.println(integer); firstCity.zipCode = 20590; System.out.println(firstCity.zipCode); secondCity = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100, \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34;); System.out.println(secondCity.zipCode); } Solution 1 20590 00100 0 20590 46100 "},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/extra/sections/install/","title":"Installing software","section":"First lab","content":" Installing software # In order to install, update and remove programming-related software (compilers, interpreters, execution environment, libraries, build automation tools, git, maven, etc.), we highly recommend using a package manager.

It revolves around the notion of a game snapshot, which contains all the information needed to describe a state of the game (equivalently, you can think of a snapshot as a save state). In particular, snapshots are independent of a specific GUI.\nFor instance, a method is available that allows you to pass a snapshot to the GUI component. When you call this method, the snapshot will be drawn on screen, replacing the previous one (if any).\nAs input, your code receives the next action of the active player (for instance, delete the unit present on a specific tile). These are again specified by an interface, with 7 method that you need to implement. Your implementation should react to each action, i.e. modify the current snapshot, and then send it the GUI component for display.\nThe README.md file (at the root of the project) contains a description of the different components and interfaces, as well as building instructions, and explains where your code could fit.

In this case, $A$ is called a subclass of $B$.\nThe intuitive meaning is inclusion between their respective sets of instances, i.e. every instance of $A$ is also an instance of $B$ (but the converse may not hold).\nThis can be paraphrased in English by \u0026ldquo;every $A$ is a $B$ \u0026ldquo;.

In the exercise above, Integer extends RationalNumber and RationalNumber extends RealNumber, therefore Integer extends RealNumber.\nAntisymmetry # If $A$ extends $B$ and $B$ extends $A$, then they are the same class.\nExample. In the exercise above, Set and UnionOfSets are (arguably) the same class.\nInheritance # Naturally, if $A$ is a subclass of $B$ then it inherits the properties of $B$.\nFor instance, a rectangle has four right angles. Since every square is a rectangle, a square has four right angles as well.\nFactorizing code with a (possibly abstract) superclass # Inheritance can be used to avoid redundant code.\nDirect inheritance: illustration # Let us model the units of our game as objects.\nEach unit has:\na type (e.g. mage, unicorn, etc.), a color (at least in the original game), and a certain amount of health. The behavior and stats of a unit (e.g. number of turns before attacking when combined, default health, etc.) are dictated by its type. So it makes sense to group units by type.\nFor instance, one can create a class Unicorn whose instances are all units of type unicorn. In Java:\npublic class Unicorn { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Unicorn(String color) { this.color = color; health = 1; attackCountdown = -1; } } Note. We used the keyword attackCountdown in this example to indicate the number of turns before the unit attacks (and a special value of -1 when it is not set to attack). But there are of course other ways to model this.\nNote. In this example, we used the prefix this. for the attribute color only, because there is no ambiguity for the two other attributes.\nWe can also create a class Butterfly on the same model\npublic class Butterfly { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Butterfly(String color) { this.color = color; health = 2; int attackCountdown = -1; } } Now consider a method encounter that manages an encounter between two units. Without inheritance, one would need to implement four versions of this method:\nunicorn vs unicorn, unicorn vs butterfly, butterfly vs unicorn, and butterfly vs butterfly. For instance, the first of these four methods could be implemented as follows:\nvoid encounter(Unicorn u1, Unicorn u2) { // subtract the health of u2 from the health of u1 u1.health -= u2.health; // the health of u2 becomes the inverse of the remaining health of u1 u2.health = -u1.health; } More generally, if the game has $n$ types of units, then the code will contain $n^2$ nearly identical encounter methods.\nQuestion. Can we use inheritance in this example to avoid duplicate code (and how)?\nObserve that a unicorn and a butterfly (viewed as object) have identical attributes (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo;), namely String color, int health, and int attackCountdown. So we can create a superclass of Unicorn and Butterfly that carries these attributes, and let the two subclasses inherit it. For instance, this superclass may be called Unit.\nWe may also want every unit in the game to have a concrete type (like \u0026ldquo;unicorn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;butterfly\u0026rdquo;), rather than being a generic \u0026ldquo;unit\u0026rdquo;. In Java, this can be achieved with the abstract keyword. This keyword ensures that our superclass cannot be directly instantiated (even though it can still have a constructor). For instance:\npublic abstract class Unit { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Unit(String color, int health) { this.color = color; this.health = health; int attackCountdown = -1; } } Because this class is abstract, the following code will not compile:\nUnit myUnit = new Unit(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, 2); Next, we can declare that Unicorn extends Unit, by using the Java keyword extends. We can also use the constructor of Unit within the constructor of Unicorn, with the Java keyword super.\nThis yields:\npublic class Unicorn extends Unit { public Unicorn(String color) { super(color, 1); } } And we can proceed similarly for the class Butterfly:\npublic class Butterfly extends Unit { public Butterfly(String color) { super(color, 2); } } Note. In Java (as opposed to C++ for instance), a class can only have one immediate superclass, so the keyword super is never ambiguous.\nObserve that all the attributes are now carried by the superclass Unit. However, because they are inherited, these attributes can be accessed as if they were regular attributes of the subclass. For instance,\nUnicorn myUnit = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); System.out.println(myUnit.health); outputs\n1 This allows us to write a generic encounter method, as follows:\nvoid encounter(Unit u1, Unit u2) { u1.health -= u2.health; u2.health = -u1.health; } And this method can be called with unicorns and/or butterflies as inputs. For instance:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;); encounter(myUnicorn, myButterfly); } Transitive inheritance # In the example above, we assumed that all units have a color and can attack. What if we also want to create a type of unit called Wall that has no color and cannot attack? An instance of this class does not need the attributes color and attackCountdown.\nA quick solution here consists is setting attackCountdown to -1, and color to null. However, unnecessary attributes make code harder to understand, and such a design may not scale well if the game is extended with more units types.\nExercise Modify our model to accommodate for the class Wall, so that an instance of Wall only has the health attribute.\nPossible solution One solution (among others) is the following:\nmodify the class Unit so that it only carries the attribute health, Wall extends Unit, create an (abstract) subclass of Unit (for instance MobileUnit) that carries the other two attributes, Butterfly and Unicorn extend MobileUnit (therefore they also extend Unit, by transitivity). Or in Java:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; public Unit(int health) { this.heath = health; } } public class Wall extends Unit { public Wall() { super(5); } } public abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { String color; int attackCountdown; public MobileUnit(String color, int health) { super(health); this.color = color; this.attackCountdown = -1; } } public class Unicorn extends MobileUnit { public Unicorn(String color) { super(color, 1); } } and similarly for Butterfly.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/docs/objects/","title":"Objects and classes","section":"Docs","content":" Objects and classes # This chapter introduces some basic notions of (class-based) object-oriented programming.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/extra/sections/ssh/","title":"Ssh key","section":"First lab","content":" Ssh key # An ssh key allows you to connect to to remote machine via the ssh protocol.\nAmong other uses, this is the preferred way to share data with a git hosting service (such as GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket).\nYou only need one ssh key per machine (laptop, desktop, phone, etc.).

With this command, you can check that you are indeed in the folder mySite.\nTo get a overview of the content of the current folder, run:\nll To get a recursive overview of the content of this folder, run:\ntree In order to navigate to a certain subfolder in this tree, we can take advantage of the fuzzy finder. For instance, let us assume that we want to move to some folder called socials, but we forgot its exact path.\nRun:\nc This will display the paths to all directories in this tree. You can type characters to restrict your search, and use the up down arrow keys to select your destination. For instance, type the three character soc. The best matches are displayed at the bottom of the list. To select one of them, navigate up and down with the arrow keys and press Enter.\nNote. Thanks to fuzzy search, the characters that you type do not need to be contiguous in a path. For instance, when you typed soc, all paths containing these three letters (in that order, but not necessarily contiguous) were retained.\nNow let us navigate back to the mySite folder. Here we can use zoxide, which uses our path navigation history to guess our destination. Run:\nz mySite (or possibly fewer letters).\nSimilarly, to go back to the socials subfolder that we previously went to:\nz socials Alternatively, you can switch between your current location and the previous one (thanks to zoxide still) with:\nzz Starting the web server # Navigate (back) to the mySite folder (you should know how to do this by now), and run:\nhugo server This will start a local development server for our website. To visualize the site, open Firefox (from the app menu), and use the address displayed in the terminal (it should be http://localhost:1313/)\nTo stop the server (or any Linux process running in a terminal), go back to the terminal an press Ctrl+C.\nNext, we will add content to our website, while keeping the server running.\nTo restart the server, we can use our command history. Type the first letters of the command that we used above to start the serve (e.g. hu). By pressing the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through the commands that you already typed and start with these letters. Scroll until you find the command hugo server, and press Enter to restart the server.\nIn order to keep the server running, we will execute our next command in another terminal. You can create a new one by clicking on the boxed \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon:\nAdding content # Navigate to the (immediate) subfolder content of mysite. Then create a subfolder named posts:\nmkdir posts Navigate to this new folder. Then create a new text file called myPost.md. You can for instance do this with the command:\ngedit myPost.md which will open the file with the test editor \u0026ldquo;gedit\u0026rdquo;.\nNote. If you only type ge followed by Tab, the shell will suggest you a list of programs whose name starts with these letters. You can scroll through them by pressing Tab again, or add a letter to disambiguate your search.\nIn the text editor, copy-paste the following content:\n+++ title = \u0026#39;My First Post\u0026#39; date = 2024-01-14T07:07:07+01:00 +++ ## Introduction This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text. ### Subsection This is a [link](https://gohugo.io) to the Hugo website. In this file, everything below the header (title/date) is written in Markdown.\nSave the file, and check with Firefox that your first post has been added to your website (to see your changes, you may need to force Firefox to clear its cache: in \u0026ldquo;Settings | Privacy \u0026amp; Security | Cookies and Site Data\u0026rdquo;, click on the \u0026ldquo;Clear Data\u0026rdquo; button).\nAliases # The command c that we used above is actually an alias for a more complex command, namely cd $(find * -type d | fzf)\nWe declared this alias in the file ~/.zshrc (remember that ~ is a shortcut for your home folder).\nLet us open this file to see the declaration of this alias. Navigate to your home folder, for instance with:\ncd And list its content:\nll The file .zshrc should be there. Open this file with gedit:\ngedit .zshrc Note. Again, you can take advantage of autocompletion here. For instance, press ged followed by Tab followed by .z followed by Tab.\nTowards the end of this file, you will see the declaration of the alias:\nalias c=\u0026#39;cd $(find * -type d | fzf)\u0026#39; Let us create another useful alias. Ubuntu has a convenient command called xdg-open that opens a file with the default application associated to this file\u0026rsquo;s extension (this is the equivalent of a double-click in a graphical file browser). Let us set a simpler name than xdg-open to execute this command. For instance o (like \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;).\nFirst, let us check that the name o is not used already for another command. Open a new terminal and run:\no You should get a \u0026ldquo;command not found\u0026rdquo; message, which confirms that this command is free.\nNow let us add the following line to the .zshrc file:\nalias o=\u0026#39;xdg-open\u0026#39; Save the file and open a new terminal.\nYou can now use the o command to open any file.\nTo see this, let us navigate back to the socials folder that we were previously in (e.g. type z so, then up arrow key and then Enter). If you list the files in this folder (with ll), you will see that they have the .svg extension. To open one of these files, you can type o and the first letters of the name of the file, then Tab for autocompletion. This will open the file with the default image viewer application on this machine.\nScripts # If you want to use an alias to execute a (possibly complex) sequence of commands, then the preferred way is to write a script.\nFor instance, we could write a script that navigates to the mySite folder and then starts the hugo server. And we may use the alias ws (like \u0026ldquo;website\u0026rdquo;) to call this script (you can check that it is free).\nNavigate to the ~/bin folder, and create a text file called ws (for instance with gedit, as we did above for the post).\nIn this file, copy-paste the following:\n#! /bin/bash cd ~/workspace/mySite hugo server start Observe that these are the two instructions for the two tasks that we want to execute. Save the file, and make it executable by running:\nsudo chmod u+x ws To test your script, close all running instances of hugo (if any), e.g. with Ctrl + C, as explained above.\nNow regardless of your location, you can type ws to start the web server.\nNote. Linux shells (such as bash or zsh) support the same language for commands and scripts. This is a full-fledged programming language (with conditional statements, loops, etc.), where an instruction can also be a command.\nTerminal-based applications # To conclude the demo, we introduce a few convenient applications that run in a terminal. These may save you time (compared to similar applications that rely on a GUI).\nripgrep # ripgrep allows you to search files that contain certain words or regular expressions (your IDE offers a similar functionality). For instance, let us assume that we want to search for all files under mySite that contain the string \u0026ldquo;Canada\u0026rdquo;.\nNavigate to the mySite folder. Then run:\nrg Canada This will display the path to each (text) file that contains this word (in this example, there is only one match), and the corresponding line numbers.\nranger # ranger is a popular terminal-based file browser.\nTo open it, type:\nranger You can navigate within the current directory with the up and down arrow keys, and in the directory tree (from child to parent and conversely) with the left and right arrow keys. Note that it also displays previews of text files.\nTo quit ranger, you can press the letter q.\nhtop # htop allows you to monitor processes running on your machine. To open it, type:\nhtop The upper part of the interface displays memory and CPU usage, whereas the lower part displays running process (sorted by CPU usage by default). You can kill a process with F9.\nTo quit htop, you can press the letter q.\nncdu # ncdu allows you to visualize the amount of disk space taken by your files and programs.\nTo open it, type:\nncdu The folders and files in the current folder are sorted by disk space, and you can navigate the directory tree using the arrow keys (like with ranger).\nTo quit ranger, you can press the letter q.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/extra/","title":"First lab","section":"Docs","content":" First lab: setting up your working environment # Terminal and text editor Shell autocompletion Installing software with a package manager Ssh key Default text editor for git Evaluation environment Using a terminal (demo) "}]
