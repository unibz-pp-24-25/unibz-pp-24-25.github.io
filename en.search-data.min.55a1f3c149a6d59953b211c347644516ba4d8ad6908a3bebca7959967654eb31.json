It is identical to a regular folder, except for a folder named .git. This folder stores (among others) the whole history of the project.\nCommit # A commit is a snapshot of a repository.\nEach commit has medatada associated to it. In particular:\nan ID, the name of the commit\u0026rsquo;s author, a timestamp, a message that describes the commit. For instance, Alice may create a fresh git repository, add some files to it, and commit these files. After this step, Alice\u0026rsquo;s repository may be pictured as follows.\nNext, Alice may modify some of these files (and/or add new ones), and commit these changes:\nNotation. In the figures below, for readability, we will omit the commits\u0026rsquo; metadata. So the above repository will be represented as:\nMain branch # By default, Alice\u0026rsquo;s commits belong the main branch of her repository (often called main or master). You can think of a branch as a timeline.\nGit keeps tack of the latest commit on this branch with a so-called \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo; (you can think of it as a variable) to that commit: Time travel # Alice can load any previous snapshot of her repository. The history of the repository will not be affected.\nTo achieve this, Git uses another \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo; called HEAD, which intuitively keeps track of the current position of Alice in the commit\u0026rsquo;s history. By default, HEAD points to the main pointer: If Alice decides to load her previous snapshot (thanks to the git checkout command), then HEAD will instead point to the corresponding commit: In this case (i.e. when it does not point to a branch pointer, but directly to a commit), the HEAD pointer is said to be in a detached state.\nBranching time # Alice may want to work on an experimental feature of her project. She can develop this feature in an \u0026ldquo;alternative timeline\u0026rdquo;, a.k.a. another branch.\nBefore creating this new branch, Alice most likely wants to travel back to her latest commit. This will move the HEAD pointer back to where it was:\nNow Alice may create a new branch, and name it myFeature. This will create a new branch pointer:\nAlice can also specify that she want to work on this new branch (using the git checkout command still). This will affect the HEAD pointer:\nNext, Alice may implement (part of) her new feature, and commit these changes. This will move the myfeature pointer forward:\nNow Alice may need to fix an urgent bug on her main branch. If she switches to the main branch (again, with git checkout), then HEAD will point to it:\nAlice may fix the bug and commit her changes. This will create a commit and move the main pointer as expected. The two branches now diverge:\nThen Alice may switch back to the myFeature branch to resume her work:\nAnd add a commit to this branch:\nHistory # The history of a branch consists of all commits on a path from the branch\u0026rsquo;s pointer to the original commit. For instance, this is the history of the myFeature branch: And this is the history of main branch: Merging branches # We left Alice\u0026rsquo;s repository in this situation: Alice is now satisfied with her new feature, and she wants to incorporate it into her main branch.\nTo do so, she first switches to the receiving branch (in this case, the main branch): Then she can merge the branch myFeature into the branch main. Because the two branches have diverged, this will generate a new commit, called a merge commit:\nBefore she can create a merge commit, Alice may need to fix potential conflicts between the diverging branches.\nIn this happens, then git will provide Alice a list of files that contain so-called \u0026ldquo;merge conflicts\u0026rdquo;. In each of theses files, each conflict will be identified as follows:\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; HEAD \u0026lt;Conflicting content from the receiving branch\u0026gt; ======= \u0026lt;Conflicting content from the merged branch\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mergedBranchName\u0026gt; After a merge # Observe that a merge commit (usually) has two parent commits. More generally:\na repository with merge commits is not a tree. in such a repository, the history of a \u0026ldquo;branch\u0026rdquo; may consists of commits from different paths. For instance, here is the history of the main branch: Note that after this merge, all commits of the myFeature branch are part of the history of the branch main.\nAlice may keep the myFeature branch for some future usage, or she may decide to delete it. In the latter case, the myFeature pointer will simply be deleted:\nFast-forward merge # If two branches have not diverged, then there is a simpler way to merge them.\nFor instance, consider Carol\u0026rsquo;s repository:\nThe branches main and experimental have not diverged. So experimental can be merged into main by simply moving the main pointer:\nIn this case, no merge commit is needed. This is called a fast-forward merge.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/errors/sections/callstack/","title":"Call stack","section":"Errors","content":" Call stack # A call stack is a stack that keeps track of the methods that are active during the execution of a program. By \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo;, we mean that an execution of the method has started and has not terminated yet.\nWhen the execution of a method starts, the method is \u0026ldquo;pushed\u0026rdquo; on top of the stack. When it terminates, the method is \u0026ldquo;popped\u0026rdquo; from the stack, and control is passed back to the method that called it (which is now on top of the stack).\nA debugger provides a representation of the successive states of a call stack, with references to the source code. This gives the illusion of source code being interpreted verbatim.\nExample. In our game, consider the following implementation of the method callReinforcement:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 public class Backend implements EventHandler { Snapshot currentSnapshot; ... @Override public void callReinforcement() { Player activePlayer = currentSnapshot.getActivePlayer(); int unitsToInsert = currentSnapshot.getSizeOfReinforcement(activePlayer); while (unitsToInsert \u0026gt; 0){ Unit unit = generateRandomUnit(); TileCoordinates coordinates = findInsertionSpot(unit); if(coordinates != null) { addUnit(coordinates, unit); unitsToInsert--; } } } private Unit generateRandomUnit() { ... } private TileCoordinates findInsertionSpot(Unit unit) { ... } private void addUnit(TileCoordinates coordinates, Unit unit) { currentSnapshot.getBoard().addUnit(coordinates.rowIndex(), coordinates.columnIndex(), unit); performUnitMerges(); } private void performUnitMerges() { ... } } When the method callReinforcement is called, it is added (a.k.a. pushed) on top of the call stack. This is rendered by a debugger as:\ncallReinforcement \u0026lt;rest of the call stack\u0026gt; If execution \u0026ldquo;reaches\u0026rdquo; Line 13, then the method generateRandomUnit is called and added to the stack:\ngenerateRandomUnit callReinforcement: 13 \u0026lt;rest of the call stack\u0026gt; When the method generateRandomUnit terminates, it passes control (as well as a Unit) back to the method that called it, namely callReinforcement, which can resume its execution:\ncallReinforcement \u0026lt;rest of the call stack\u0026gt; Similarly, when execution \u0026ldquo;reaches\u0026rdquo; Line 14, findInsertionSpot is added to the stack, executed, and then removed from the stack, passing control back to callReinforcement.\nThen if execution \u0026ldquo;reaches\u0026rdquo; Line 16, addUnit is executed, which in turn calls performUnitMerges:\nperformUnitMerges addUnit: 32 callReinforcement: 16 \u0026lt;rest of the call stack\u0026gt; etc.\nNote. If a method is recursive (i.e. if it calls itself, directly or indirectly), then it may appear multiple times in the call stack. E.g.:\nmethod1 method2: 16 method1: 8 \u0026lt;rest of the call stack\u0026gt; Definition. A stack overflow occurs when the size of the call stack exceeds the capacity allowed by the execution environment. This is usually due to a non-terminating recursive method.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/background/sections/problem/","title":"Computational problem","section":"Background","content":" Computational problem # A computational problem is (usually) specified as:\na set of possible inputs, and the expected outputs (for these inputs). Problem vs algorithm # For instance, here is a problem that you may have encountered already:\nInput: a sorted array $A$ of integers, an integer $a$ Output: true if $a$ appears in $A$, false otherwise There are (infinitely) many algorithms that can solve this problem. But some of them are more efficient than others. Efficiency (a.k.a. computational cost) refers to the time and/or memory needed to execute an algorithm, expressed as a function of the size of the input (more on this later).\nExercise Can you think of (or do you already know) an algorithm that can solve this problem efficiently? Why is it efficient?\nSolution Algorithm. Let $n$ be the size of $A$, and let us assume for simplicity that arrays are $1$-indexed and that $A$ is nonempty.\nIf $n = 1$, then check whether $A$[1] $= a$. Otherwise: check whether $A[n/2] = a$ (where \u0026ldquo;$/$\u0026rdquo; is integer division, rounded up or down if $n$ is odd), depending on the result, repeat on either the left or the right half of $A$. Cost. If $A$ has length $n$, then the number of iterations of the procedure is (in the order of) $\\log_2 n$ in the worst case (e.g. if $a$ does not appear in $A$).\nHere is another problem that you may know:\nInput: an array of integers Output: an array with the same values, but sorted in ascending order And yet another:\nInput: a solvable grid of sudoku Output: the same grid, solved Note. A problem specifies what a program should do, not how to do it. In other words, a computational problem is not an algorithm.\nFor instance, the following is not a computational problem:\nInput: an array of integers. Algorithm: initialize a counter to $1$. Then iterate through the array, and: increment the counter each time two consecutive numbers are encountered, or reset the counter to $1$ otherwise. Exercise Which problem does this algorithm solve? Is this algorithm efficient?\nSolution Input: an array $A$ of integers Output: the length of the longest suffix of $A$ that consists of consecutive numbers Formulating a problem # When developing a project, it can be helpful to express some sub(tasks) as computational problems. This is also a common way to document your code.\nFor instance the Javadoc of a class may consist of computational problems (e.g. the Javadoc for the method endsWith of the class String in Java).\nWhen formulating a problem, make sure that:\nthe output is specified for all inputs, and the formulation is non-ambiguous, meaning that it should clearly specify whether any given pair (input, output) is correct. Exercise Consider the class Unit (and its subclasses), as defined in the section about inheritance. The following problem is not properly defined. Can you see why?\nInput: a nonempty array A of instances of the class Unit Output: the unicorn with highest health in A Solution There may be no unicorn in A, or several healthiest unicorns.\nExercise The following problem is not properly defined. Can you see why?\nInput: a (finite) family of (finite) sets Output: the smallest set that has a nonempty intersection with each of the input sets (where \u0026ldquo;smallest\u0026rdquo; here refers to the size of a set) For instance, for the input\n{ {a,c,k}, {a,b}, {a,m}, {c,d,f}, {c,e} } the expected output is\n{a,c} Solution Some inputs admit more than one solution (the simplest example is the input {{a,b}}).\nNote. A problem may admit several outputs for the same input without being ambiguous. For instance:\nInput: a graph G, two nodes s and t in G, Output: one of the shortest paths from s to t in G if any, and null otherwise. A problem may be undecidable, meaning that for any algorithm attempting to solve this problem, there (provably) exist (infinitely many) inputs for which the algorithm either produces an incorrect output or does not terminate.\nA problem may be decidable but intractable, meaning that (provably) no efficient algorithm can solve it (where cost is once again measured as a function of the size of the input).\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/multithreading/sections/concurrency/","title":"Concurrency","section":"Multithreading","content":" Concurrency # Core # A core is a basic processing unit.\nA Central Processing Unit (CPU) contains one or several cores (e.g. 4 or 8).\nA Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) can contain thousands of cores.\nParallelism vs concurrency # Terminology.

Then convert it into an iterative algorithm.\nPossible solution Tail recursive algorithm:\nint occ(char[] A, char c) { return occRec(A, c, 0, 0) } int occRec(char[] A, char c, int i, int occurences) { // Base case: the segment under consideration is empty if(i == A.length){ return 0; } // Inductive case. // If the current character is c, then increment the number of occurrences. if (A[i] == c) { occurrences++; } // Recursive call return occRec(A, c, i + 1, occurrences) } Iterative algorithm:\nint occ(char[] A, char c) { int occurrences = 0 for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; A.length; i++) { if (A[i] == c) { occurrences++ } } return occurrences } A common strategy to convert a linear recursive method into a tail-recursive one consists in using additional arguments (like the argument occurrences in the above example). These extra arguments are sometimes called accumulators.\nUsage # Linear recursive implementations are not very frequent, because most of them can be easily converted into iterative ones, as illustrated above. Besides, as we explained above, the iterative solution is often more efficient (at least memory-wise) for large inputs.\nHowever, some problems can be easier to solve in a linear recursive form (e.g. as a first attempt). This may also produce code that is easier to read and/or debug.\nIn particular, it may be the case when manipulating linked lists.\nLinked list # Definition. A linked list is a set of objects organized in a sequence, such that each object (except for the last one) points to its successor.\nEquivalently, a linked list is a unary tree (and conversely), i.e. a tree where each node has exactly one (possibly null) child.\nFor instance:\nTerminology.\nthe first object in a linked list is often called the head of the list, and the rest of the list (i.e. the sublist with the second object as head) is often called the tail of the list. Example # Exercise Consider linked lists that consist of instances of the following class:\nWrite (in pseudocode) a linear recursive algorithm Node removeDuplicates(Node head) that:\ntakes as input the head of a list with nodes sorted according to their label (in alphabetical order), returns the head of a list with the same labels, in alphabetical order, but where each label appears exactly once. For instance, for the following input list:\nthe algorithm should output a list with labels:\nPossible solution Node removeDuplicates(Node head) { // Base case: empty list. if(head == null) { return null } // Inductive case. // Remove all duplicate in the tail. Node tailHead = removeDuplicates(head.next) // Compare the head with the (possibly new) head of the tail. if (tailHead != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; head.label == tailHead.label) { // If they have the same label, then return the tail. return tailHead } // Otherwise add the head to the returned list. head.next = tailHead return head } "},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/abstractdatatypes/sections/list/","title":"List","section":"Abstract data types","content":" List # The abstract data type list simulates a tuple.\nAccordingly, a list may contain duplicates.\nA list may expose the following methods:\nisEmpty is self-explanatory, append adds an element at the end of the list, prepend adds an element at the beginning of the list, tail returns the sub-list identical to the current one, but without its first element, etc. Note. The size of a list is often unbounded (as opposed to the size of an array for instance). This can be implemented in different ways, for instance with a dynamic array or a linked list.\nin Java # Java has an interface List with 8 native implementations (i.e. 8 different classes that implement this interface).

This means that the application:\ndoes not need a graphical user interface (but may have one), should perform non-trivial backend task(s) (e.g. writing and/or reading to/from files is not sufficient). Guidelines # Motivation # A good projects is driven by an idea.\nFeel free to design your application so that it matches your own interests. For instance:\nrelate it to a hobby (music, cinema, fashion, sport, games, social media, astronomy, etc.), use the project as an opportunity to explore a topic that you are curious about (natural language processing, computer vision, recommender systems, robotics, etc.), develop a functionality that one of your favorite applications is missing. Do not hesitate to be ambitious at first. You can restrict the scope of your project (to certain features or components) later on.\nSpecification # A frequent source of failure for this course is students focusing on tools (e.g. following tutorials) without having a precise objective. The short deadline (June 2025) does not give you this flexibility. Besides, without a precise objective, the amount of libraries that are available to you (especially in Java) can be overwhelming.\nSo we recommend you to clarify what your application should do, before thinking about how you could implement it. In other words, specify which problem(s) (i.e. input and expected output) your program and/or components should solve. Then only think about algorithms, libraries, tools and/or tutorials that can help you solve these problems.\nIn order to determine whether your specification is precise enough, you may check whether it leaves some doubt as to whether an output is correct or not.\nUser interface # Developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) requires familiarity with a graphical framework. Learning the details of such a framework (terminology, syntax, setup, etc.) can be an important time investment, and this knowledge may not transfer to other graphical frameworks. In other words, developing a GUI may not require lot of thinking, but a lot of reading (and web browsing).\nBeware also that GUIs technologies are still rapidly evolving, and that recent innovation has largely been driven by web development. So learning a graphical framework for Java may not be a strategic investment of your time (compared to learning a Javascript framework like React or Angular). Note that even desktop and mobile applications are increasingly relying on web technologies for their GUIs (thanks to frameworks like Electron or React Native).\nThis is why we recommend you to think carefully before committing to a Java GUI, and to keep it minimal if you do. Note also that we will not evaluate your project based on aesthetic criteria.\nSo in order to design your interface, you may follow the following guidelines:\nAsk yourself whether your application really needs a GUI. A command-line interface (CLI) may be sufficient, because: your program takes files as input and produces files as output, or your program is (primarily) meant to be used by other programs (rather than human beings), or your program is meant to be used by other developers, or external programs with GUIs (such as IDEs) can easily call your application, or you leave the GUI for future work (again, your application is just a prototype), etc. If you really need a GUI, then: decouple frontend and backend (whenever possible), so that the backend could be used with another frontend, and conversely. Many applications accessible via GUI have a natural decoupling of frontend and backend. Example. Consider an application that allows booking hotel rooms. The backend takes as input some data (e.g. number or guests, arrival date, departure date, etc.), and outputs data as well (available rooms, prices, etc.). These input and outputs are objects, integers, strings, etc. They do not depend on a specific GUI (windows, menus, buttons, colors, etc.).\nExample. Even for some games, frontend and backend can easily be decoupled. Consider for instance a program that plays chess against a human opponent. The backend:\nkeeps track of the current state of the board, takes as input either a move from the white player, or a request to play as the (bot) black player, outputs the next state of the board. These input and output do not depend on a specific GUI (they can for instance be encoded using algebraic notation). So the backend can be implemented without any reference to graphical elements or controller inputs (mouse clicks, etc.).\ndevelop the backend first (and write unit tests for it),\ndevelop the frontend afterwards (if you have time for it).\nIf you really need a GUI, then try to keep it minimal. In particular, restrict the input to what is essential for your application (the more freedom the user is given, the more likely he/she is to input a sequence of actions that your program cannot handle).

A central class in this package is File.\nOver the years, programmers realized that this package had limitations: limited error handling, limited support for file metadata (owner, access rights, etc.), and some performance issues.\nWith Java 7 (2011), A new I/O package called NIO2 was released, with additional features (and in some cases a more concise syntax). A central interface (resp. utility class) in this package is Path (resp. Files).\nHowever, the package java.io is still part of the latest Java release (it has not been deprecated), in part for backward compatibility reasons.\nIn this chapter, we will focus whenever possible on NIO2\u0026rsquo;s classes and methods, rather than java.io. In particular, we will use Path when possible rather than File.\nNote also that some external libraries (notably Apache commons.io and Guava) provide additional methods for I/O, sometimes with a more concise syntax.\nWarning. Many native Java methods that involve path or file manipulation may throw a checked exception (generally an IOException). For instance, among the methods below, this is the case of:\nPath.toRealPath, Files.size, Files.walk, etc. As a reminder, when such a method is used, checked exceptions must be either caught or explicitly rethrown, otherwise the program will not compile.\nPaths # An instance of Path represents a path in the hierarchical file system.\nAn instance of Path can be created in multiple ways.

If the string path/to/file.txt is used to create a Java Path (or a Java File), then the / symbol is interpreted (at runtime) as the path separator of the operating system (OS) that executes the program. So you can safely use this syntax, regardless of your OS. Precisely:\nif the program is executed on macOS, Linux, Android, etc., then this string will be interpreted as is, if the program is executed on Windows, then this string will be interpreted as path\\to\\file.txt. Warning. If the string path\\to\\file.txt is used to create a Java Path, then this string will be interpreted as is. So the program may run on Windows, but fail on other systems.\nWarning. Paths are case-sensitive (by default) on Linux, Android, etc., but case insensitive (by default) on Windows and macOS. For maximal compatibility, make sure that path names in your code respect the case of your file and directory names.\nWarning. Do not use absolute paths in your code (e.g. /home/alice/workspace/javaProject/myFile.txt, or C:\\Users\\alice\\workspace\\javaProject\\myFile.txt).

List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units = getUnits(); Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; butterflyColors = units.stream() // create a stream .filter(u -\u0026gt; u instanceof Butterfly) // retain butterflies .map(b -\u0026gt; b.color) // map each butterfly to its color .collect(Collectors.toSet()); // collect the colors as a set Explanation # This pipeline can be decomposed as follows:\nSource # The instance method Collection.stream generates a stream out of a collection (e.g. out of a List or a Set):\nunits.stream() In this example, because units has type List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt;, the stream that is returned by units.stream() has type Stream\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt;.\nIntermediate operations # Filter # .filter(u -\u0026gt; u instanceof Butterfly) The instance method Stream.filter retains certain elements of the stream.\nLet us assume that the stream has type Stream\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt; (for instance, in our example, $\\mathit{T}$ is Unit).\nThe method filter takes as argument a callback function of type\n$\\qquad \\mathit{T} \\to$ Boolean\n(equivalently, in Java\u0026rsquo;s terminology, the callback function must implement the native functional interface Predicate\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt;).\nIn this example, the callback function is\nu -\u0026gt; u instanceof Butterfly which has type\n$\\qquad$ Unit $\\to$ Boolean\nThe method filter returns a Stream\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt; (e.g. in this example a Stream\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt;) that consists of the elements for which the callback method evaluates to true (in this case, it retains only butterflies).\nMap # .map(b -\u0026gt; b.color) The instance method Stream.map applies a function to each element of the stream.\nLet us assume that the stream has type Stream\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt; (for instance, in our example, $\\mathit{T}$ is Unit).\nThe method map takes as argument a callback function of type\n$\\qquad T \\to T'$\nwhere $T\u0026rsquo;$ can be any type (equivalently, in Java\u0026rsquo;s terminology, the callback function must implement the native functional interface Function\u0026lt;$T$,$T\u0026rsquo;$\u0026gt;, seen earlier).\nIn this example, the callback function is\nb -\u0026gt; b.color which has type\n$\\qquad$ Unit $\\to$ String\nLet us name this callback function $f$.\nThe method map returns a Stream\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T\u0026rsquo;}$\u0026gt; (e.g. in this example a Stream\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;) that consists of all objects $f(a)$ such that $a$ belongs to the original stream.\nTerminal operation # .collect(Collectors.toSet()); The instance method Stream.collect takes as argument a so-called Collector, which is in charge of collecting the elements of the stream into a Collection (e.g. List or Set), or a Map, a String, etc.\nIn this example, we call the static method Collectors.toSet, which returns a collector that produces a set. Because the stream has type Stream\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;, the instruction .collect(Collectors.toSet()) returns a set with type Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;.\nReading a pipeline # Exercise What do the following methods compute?\nSet\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; method1(Set\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; set1, Set\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; set2) { return set1.stream() .filter(u -\u0026gt; set2.contains(u)) .collect(Collectors.toSet()); } Set\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; method2(Set\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; set1, Set\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; set2) { return set1.stream() .filter(set2::contains) .collect(Collectors.toSet()); } Solution Both methods compute the intersection of set1 and set2.\nExercise What do the methods method1 to method4 below compute?\nStream\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; method1(List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units) { return units.stream() .filter(u -\u0026gt; u.health \u0026gt; 0); } List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; method2(Stream\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; stream) { return stream.map(u -\u0026gt; transform(u)) .toList(); // collects the stream into a list } Unit transform(Unit u) { if (u instanceof Caterpillar) { return new Butterfly(u.color, u.health); } return u; } List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; method3(List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units) { return method2(method1(units)); } List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; method4(List\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units) { return units.stream() .filter(u -\u0026gt; u.health \u0026gt; 0) .map(u -\u0026gt; u instanceof Caterpillar ? new Butterfly(u.color, u.health) : u ) .toList(); } Solution method1: Input: A list of units.

The following Java program does not compile.\nString banana = \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;; banana += 1; Languages that are not statically typed are called dynamically typed.\nThis include interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) languages like Javascript, Lua, PHP or Ruby, but also Python (which is precompiled, like Java).\nDynamically typed languages have limited (if any) syntactic support for types (like int or Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; in Java), whereas statically-typed languages (especially functional languages) can have complex typing systems.\nStatic and dynamic typing have their respective benefits and drawbacks (each being more adapted to certain use cases). Here are some of some common arguments:\nRobustness: static typing allows some errors to be identified earlier during the development process. In a dynamic context, type-related bugs can only be identified via testing (possibly after release).\nDocumentation: the signature of a method (i.e. its input and return types) can be a useful indication of how it is meant to be used.\nProductivity: dynamically typed languages allow focusing on algorithmic aspects, without the need to write or reason about types. As a result, programs may be written significantly faster. Conversely, the absence of compile-time type checks may increase debugging time.\nConciseness: an algorithm can be significantly easier to understand without the overhead introduced by a (possibly complex) typing system.\nType safety and generic programming # Type safety is the extent to which a typing system prevents or discourages type errors. This is usually understood as a property of statically typed languages.\nType safety often conflicts with reusing and factorizing code, in particular for algorithms that manipulate data structures. This is one of the main practical motivations behind generic programming, which allows maintaining type safety (to some extent) while abstracting from specific data types.\nFor instance, with generic programming, a sorting algorithm (like Mergesort) can be implemented only once for different types of arrays (Integer[], City[], Unit[], etc.) and sorting criteria, while preventing some typing errors.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/lambda/sections/anonymous/","title":"Anonymous method","section":"First-class methods","content":" Anonymous method # An anonymous method is a method without a name.\nIllustration # We saw earlier that two mathematical functions may only differ by their names.

A possible class for these two objects may enforce this structure, and it could be named City. An object that follows this blueprint is called an instance of this class.\nDeclaration # In a typed language (like Java), a class must specify not only the \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo; of its instances, but also their types. For instance, the class City could be declared as follows in Java:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; ... } In Java, a class is often declared in a dedicated file. This file must have the same name as the class (e.g. City.java in this example).\nThe three variables (name, zipCode and region) are called attributes (or sometimes member variables).\nConstructor # A class also needs a special method called a constructor.\nThe constructor is in charge of creating a (fresh) instance of the class.\nNote. A class may have several constructors (with different signatures).\nWriting a constructor in Java # The constructor of a Java class must have the same name as the class.\nFor instance:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; public City(String n, int z, String r){ name = n; zipCode = z; region = r; } ... } Note. In this example, the variable names n, z and r are not very explicit. However, using name, zipCode and region would be ambiguous (because these names are already used for the attributes of the class). In Java, we can use the prefix this. to refer to attribute names, thus eliminating the ambiguity.\nFor instance:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; public City(String name, int zipCode, String region){ this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipCode; this.region = region; } ... } Calling a constructor in Java # A Java constructor is called with the keyword new.

In Java (as in Python, C#, etc.), the constructor does not return the instance itself, but a reference (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo;) to this instance.\nNote. The object that is created in memory contains extra information, in particular a reference to its class. This allows type checking, casts, etc. (more on this later).\nDefault constructor # If a class has no explicit constructor, then a default constructor is generated by the compiler. This constructor has no argument.\nExample. The following class has no constructor:\npublic class GhostTown { String name; } But an instance can nonetheless be created with the default constructor:\nGhostTown anonymousCity = new GhostTown(); Accessing an object in Java # The attributes of an object can be accessed like regular variables, using ., followed by the name of the attribute.

So in the examples above, the value of each variable (myCity, yourCity and thatCity) is a reference, not the object itself.\nThis also holds for variable with an array type (like int[] myArray).\nThe types of these variables (e.g. City or int[]) are called reference types.\nSyntax. In Java, types that start with a capital letter (like City or Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;) are usually reference types.\nTypes that are not references types (like int or char) are called primitive types.\nIn Java, the value of a reference cannot be output (printed, displayed, etc.) by a program (as opposed to C/C++ for instance).

Two common strategies are:\npassing by value: the method receives as input a copy of each argument, passing by reference: the method receives as input a reference to each argument (which allows the method to modify the initial argument). Consider for instance the following program (in pseudocode):\nint myInteger = 0 myMethod(myInteger) print(myInteger) void myMethod(int argument){ argument += 1 } If the argument is passed by value, then the program will print 0. If the argument is passed by reference, then the program will print 1. Java passes by value # In Java (and many other programming languages, like C, Python, Javascript, etc.), arguments are passed by value. So the above program translated in Java will print 0.\nWarning. Consider a method with a reference type argument. Because Java passes by value, this method will receive a copy of this argument.

For instance, it may be refactored later on (moving code where it logically belongs, factorizing duplicate code, etc.). However, the tests that were written before refactoring are (usually) still relevant afterwards, because they correspond to functional requirements.\nBenefits # Some benefits of TDD are:\nStarting from an example often helps clarifying what a method should do. TDD provides intermediate objectives (milestones) to a developer. The sooner a bug is identified (during the development process), the easier it is to fix. The program is likely to be more robust, because development was guided by requirements (rather than technologies or algorithmic considerations). Each unit test created during TDD provides an alternative entry point (\u0026ldquo;green arrow\u0026rdquo; in an IDE) into the codebase (in addition to the \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; method). This allows experimenting with a specific feature in isolation, ignoring aspects that are not relevant for this feature (e.g. GUI, network, data storage, etc.). Example # In our game, let us consider once again the method EventHandler.deleteUnit, which modifies the current board when a unit deletion instruction is received.\nProblem decomposition # First, let us decompose this method into simpler ones. For instance as follows:\npublic class Backend implements EventHandler { private Snapshot currentSnapshot; ... void deleteUnit(int rowindex, int columnIndex) { // reduce by 1 the number of remaining actions for the active player decrementNumberOfRemainingActions(); // delete the unit (leaving a blank tile) currentSnapshot.getBoard().removeUnit(rowIndex, columnIndex); // shift up or down the units that followed it (if any) shiftUnitsInColumn(columnIndex); // perform resulting unit merges (if any) performUnitMerges(); // if there is no more action for the active player, then end the turn if (currentSnapshot.getNumberOfRemainingActions() == 0){ endTurn(); } } ... } At first sight, the auxiliary method decrementNumerOfRemainingActions seems trivial, so it may not benefit from unit tests. The method shiftUnitsInColumn seems relatively simple as well. However, the two remaining ones (performUnitMerges and endTurn) seem more complex. So it could be helpful to decompose them and/or devise unit tests for them.\nLet us focus on endTurn. It may for instance be decomposed as follows:\nvoid endTurn() { // perform attacks for units whose counter is 1 // (on the active player\u0026#39;s side) performAttacks(); // change the active player swapActivePlayer(); } And performAttacks may in turn be decomposed as follows:\nvoid performAttacks() { int maxColumnIndex = currentSnapshot.getBoard().getMaxColumnIndex(); // for each column for (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex \u0026lt;= maxColumnIndex; columnIndex++){ performAttacks(columnIndex); } } void performAttack(int columnIndex) { // for each combined unit in this column (for the active player), // starting from front units for (MobileUnit unit: getCombinedUnits(columnIndex)){ int countdown = unit.getAttackCountdown(); if(countdown \u0026gt; 1) { unit.setAttackCountdown(countdown - 1); // if the unit is ready to attack } else { attack(columnIndex); } } } Unit test # The auxiliary method attack seems non-trivial, so it may be a good candidate for unit testing.\nOne possible (\u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo;) test could be:\nInput (for column 1):\nExpected output:\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/errors/sections/exceptions/","title":"Exceptions","section":"Errors","content":" Exceptions # Programming languages may significantly differ in the way they support errors messages.\nJava relies on a mechanism called exceptions. Several other languages use exceptions, for instance C++, C#, PHP, Python or Ruby. However, the purpose of exceptions may vary from one language to another.\nAn exception is an object or data structure that stores information about an exceptional condition encountered during the execution of a program.\nin Java # In Java, an exception is an object, instance of the native class Exception.\nAll exception types (e.g. IOException) are subclasses of Exception.\nBy convention, a class name for an exception:\nends with the word Exception, and provides information about the cause of the exception. Stack trace # By default, when an exception is thrown, the program interrupts its execution, and the current call stack is sent to an output stream called System.error. This output is called the stack trace (because it allows tracing back the method calls that led to the exception being thrown).\nFor instance, consider the following class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 public class MyClass{ void myMethod(){ Integer.parseInt(\u0026#34;clearlyNotANumber\u0026#34;); } } When myMethod is executed, the following stack trace is printed to System.error:\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \u0026#34;clearlyNotANumber\u0026#34; at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:67) at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:668) at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:786) at Myclass.myMethod(Myclass.java:4) \u0026lt;rest of the stack trace\u0026gt; The explanation is the following:\nmyMethod (Line 4) calls Integer.parseInt(String string), Integer.parseInt(String string) calls Integer.parseInt(String string, int radix) with the same string as argument, and a value of 10 for the radix (meaning that the string should represent an integer in base 10). Integer.parseInt(String string, int radix) throws an exception, because the string \u0026ldquo;clearlyNotANumber\u0026rdquo; does not represent a (base 10) number. Hint. Your IDE allows you to navigate through Java\u0026rsquo;s source code to trace the cause of an exception.\nHint. To debug your code, by default:\nfind the last method (from bottom to top) in the stack trace that was written by you (in this example Myclass.myMethod), using our IDE, create a breakpoint at the indicated line for this class (4 in this example), run your program in debug mode (e.g. clicking on the \u0026ldquo;bug\u0026rdquo; icon of your IDE). Throwing an exception # An exception can be thrown with the keyword throw, as follows:\nboolean isSolvable(int[][] sudokuGrid){ if(sudokuGrid.length != 9){ throw new IllegalArgumentException(\u0026#34;A sudoku grid should have 9 rows\u0026#34;); } if(sudokuGrid[0].length != 9){ throw new IllegalArgumentException(\u0026#34;A sudoku grid should have 9 columns\u0026#34;); } ... } Classes for native Java exceptions usually have several constructors, one of which takes a string as input. For instance, in the example above, we used the constructor IllegalArgumentException(String errorMessage).\nCatching an exception # When a runtime exception is thrown by a method, the method immediately below it in the call stack can either rethrow the exception, or catch it.\nIf some method in the call stack catches the exception, then the program is not interrupted. Instead, control is passed to the catching method.\nIn other words, when an exception is thrown, the JVM \u0026ldquo;pops\u0026rdquo; method calls from the call stack, until either:\na catching method is found, or the call stack is empty (in which case the program is interrupted). For instance, let us modify myMethod above so that:\nit takes as input a string (maybe supplied at run time), if this string can be converted to an integer, then it returns this integer, otherwise it returns 0. This can be achieved by catching the exception thrown by Integer.parseInt. Syntactically, this is done with a try/catch block, as follows:\nint myMethod(String inputString){ try { return Integer.parseInt(inputString); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { return 0; } } In this example:\nthe code inside the try block is always executed, the code inside the catch block is only executed if a NumberFormatException is thrown during the execution of the try block, the program is not interrupted. Chaining # The catch clause may itself throw an exception.\nThis is a very common pattern. In particular, it can be used to add information about the context in which an error occurred. In such a case, a common practice consists in chaining these two exceptions.\nMost native Java classes for exceptions have a dedicated constructor for this purpose: it takes as input a string (for the error message), and the exception that was caught. For instance, we can modify our example in such a way that if the input string cannot be converted to an integer, then the program gets interrupted, but with a less generic error message:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public class MyClass{ int myMethod(String inputString){ try{ return Integer.parseInt(inputString); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\u0026#34;Please provide a valid number\u0026#34;, e); } } } Note in this example the second argument e of the constructor for IllegalArgumentException.\nIf the method is called as follows,\nmyMethod(\u0026#34;notANumberEither\u0026#34;); then the program will be interrupted, with the following stack trace:\nJava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Please provide a valid number at MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:7) \u0026lt;rest of the stack trace\u0026gt; Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \u0026#34;notANumberEither\u0026#34; at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:67) at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:668) at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:786) at MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:5) "},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/generics/sections/generics/","title":"Generics","section":"Generic programming","content":" Generics # Terminology.

Solution # We can factorize our code without sacrificing type safety, by using a type variable $T$ that stands for \u0026ldquo;any subtype of Unit\u0026rdquo;. In order words, we can create a method healthiest with type:\n$\\qquad T$[] $\\to T$\nwhere $T$ can be any subtype of Unit.\nTerminology # A method with (one or several) type variables is called a generic method.\nSyntax in Java # Declaration # The generic method in our example can be written as follows:\n\u0026lt;T extends Unit\u0026gt; T healthiest(T[] units) { ... } The block \u0026lt;T extends Unit\u0026gt;:\ndeclares the type variable T, and specifies that the value of T must be a subtype of Unit. In other words, Unit is an \u0026ldquo;upper bound\u0026rdquo; on the value of T. So in our example, T can take the value Unit, Butterfly or Unicorn. This variable T can be used not only in the method\u0026rsquo;s signature, but also in its body.\nExample. We could implement our method in the following (unnecessarily verbose) way. Observe that the type T also appears in the body of the method:\n\u0026lt;T extends Unit\u0026gt; T healthiest (T[] units) { T selected = Arrays.stream(units) .max((u1, u2) -\u0026gt; u1.health - u2.health) .orElse(null); return selected; } Warning. In this example, T is a (type) variable. So any other variable name could be used, for instance\n\u0026lt;X extends Unit\u0026gt; X healthiest (X[] units) { ... } or\n\u0026lt;TypeOfUnit extends Unit\u0026gt; TypeOfUnit healthiest (TypeOfUnit[] units) { ... } By convention, the letters T, E and V are often used for type variables (as well as R if the type variable is used for the return type of a method).\nIf there is no upper bound on the type variable (in other words, if the upper bound is Object), then the extends statement can be omitted.\nExample.\n\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; T myMethod (T arg1, String arg2) { ... } It is also possible to declare several type variables.\nExample.\n\u0026lt;T extends Unit, V\u0026gt; T myMethod (T arg1, V arg2) { } Method call # A generic method can be called by replacing types variables with concrete types (in a way that is consistent with the method declaration).\nExamples.

A parameterized type is a generic type whose type variables are instantiated.\nExamples. In Java:\nSet\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; is a parameterized type,\nFunction\u0026lt;Unit, Boolean\u0026gt; is another parameterized type.\nUsage # Generic types serve the same purpose as generic methods, i.e. factorizing code without sacrificing type safety.\nFor some object-oriented languages (like Java or C++), generic types are instrumental in factorizing the implementation of abstract data types (such as lists, sets, associative arrays or queues).\nExample. The generic Java class HashSet\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; provides a unique instance method to add an element to the set. This method has signature boolean add(E e).\nSyntax in Java # Declaration # We can declare type variables whose scope is an entire Java class (resp. interface, record).\nThe declaration of these type variables is identical to the one we saw above for methods, but the \u0026ldquo;diamond\u0026rdquo; is immediately next to the class (resp. record, interface) name (rather than left of the method declaration):\nExample. We can create a generic wrapper class Box (similar to Java\u0026rsquo;s Optional), as follows:\npublic class Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { ... } These type variables are visible in the whole the class (resp. record, interface) body.\nExample.\npublic class Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { T boxedValue; public Box(T boxedValue){ this.boxedValue = boxedValue; } T get(){ if(boxedValue != null) { return boxedValue; } ... } ... } Warning. The value of the type variables (e.g. the value of T in the above example) may vary from one instance of the generic class to the other. Therefore a type variable associated to a class (resp. interface) cannot be used:\nin a static method of this class (resp. interface), or as the type of a static attribute of this class (resp. interface). For instance, the following class does not compile:\npublic class Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { static T myAttribute; ... } Instantiation # An instance of a generic class (resp. record) can be created by providing parameter types when calling its constructor.\nExample.\nBox\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; myBoxedString = new Box\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;); Syntactic sugar. In this example, the second type parameter String (used with the constructor) is redundant. So it can be safely be omitted:\nBox\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; myBoxedString = new Box\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;); Instance method call # A method declared in a generic class (or interface or record) can be called like a generic method (with the same restriction as the ones described above).\nExample.

An associative array (or map) is a finite set of key-value pairs, where keys are distinct.\nTerminology. A key-value pair in an associative array is also called an entry.\nRunning example. The following associative array has 5 entries.\n$\\qquad$ 1 $\\mapsto$ Alice $\\qquad$ 3 $\\mapsto$ Bob $\\qquad$ 4 $\\mapsto$ Carol $\\qquad$ 9 $\\mapsto$ Dan $\\qquad$ 12 $\\mapsto$ Eve\nIn this associative array, keys are integers, and values are strings.\nNotation. We will use $K$ for the type of the keys (integers in this example), and $V$ for the type of the values (strings in this example).\nStructure # A hash table is an array $A$, whose entries are called slots (or buckets).\nHash tables come in two varieties:\nchaining hash tables and hash tables with open indexing. In a chaining hash table, each slot is a pointer to a data structure (typically a linked list). These data structures store the entries (a.k.a. key-value pairs) of the associative array.\nExample (continued). The following is a chaining hash table, which stores our associative array.\nThe array has 4 slots, each of which points to a (possibly empty) linked list.\nIn a hash table with open indexing, each slot stores one entry of the associative array.\nWe will discuss open indexing later in this section (and focus for now on chaining hash tables).\nHash function # In a hash table, a so-called hash function determines which slot each entry is assigned to.\nDefinition. A hash function maps each key in $K$ to an index in $A$.\nExample (continued). In the above example, we used\n$\\qquad h(k) = k \\mod 4$\nas our hash function.\nFor instance,\n$\\qquad h(9) = 9 \\mod 4 = 1$\nwhich explains why the entry\n$\\qquad$ $9 \\mapsto$ Dan\nis assigned to slot $1$.\nCollision # The size of the set $K$ of possible keys is often (much) larger than the size of the hash table $A$.\nExample (continued). In our example, $K$ is the set of integers. In Java, this set has size $2^{32}$ (i.e. more than 4 billion), which is unrealistic for the size of $A$.\nAs a consequence, hashing functions are usually not injective.\nTerminology. A collision occurs when two entries of an associative array are assigned to the same slot.\nIn other words, a collision occurs if the associative array contains two entries ${k_1 \\mapsto v_1}$ and ${k_2 \\mapsto v_1}$ such that $h(k_1) = h(k_2)$.\nExample (continued). In the example above, 1 $\\mapsto$ Alice and 9 $\\mapsto$ Dan are assigned to the same slot, because\n$$ h(1) = h(9) = 1 $$\nCollisions are often unavoidable (this is a consequence of what is sometimes called the birthday paradox).\nExample. Let us assume that our hashing function $h$ partitions $K$ evenly across slots (like the function $h(x) = x \\mod 4$ used above).\nIf $A$ has $16$ slots (which is the default size of a hash table in Java), then the probability of a collision is $\\ge 0.5$ for $5$ entries already\nIf $A$ has $1000$ slots, then the probability of a collision is $\\ge 0.5$ for $38$ entries already, and $\\ge 0.9$ for $69$ entries already.\nPerformance # Reminder. An associative array exposes (at least) the following methods:\nlookup (or get) takes a key as input, and returns the value for this key (if any). insert (or put ) inserts a pair (key, value). If an entry for this key was already present, then overwrites its value. remove (or delete) deletes the entry for a given key (if any). Worst case # In a chained hash table, in order to check whether the structure contains an entry for an input key $k$, we need to:\ncompute $h(k)$ search for an entry with key $k$ in the data structure that $A[h(k)]$ refers to (if any). Exercise Consider a associative array with $n$ entries, stored as a chained hash table with linked lists (as above).\nWhat is the worst case asymptotic running time of the lookup operation?\nInstead, what would be the best possible scenario?\nSolution A worst possible input (of size $n$) for the lookup operation consists of an input key $k$ and an input hash table $A$ with hash function $h$ such that, for each pair $k\u0026rsquo; \\mapsto v$ stored in $A$:\n$k\u0026rsquo; \\neq k$ and $h(k\u0026rsquo;) = h(k)$. In this case, any algorithm for lookup would need to inspect the whole list $A[h(k)]$. So the worst-case running time of such an algorithm is in $\\Theta(n)$.\nA best possible input consists of an input key $k$ and an input hash table $A$ with hash function $h$ such that $h(k\u0026rsquo;) \\neq h(k)$ for each pair $k\u0026rsquo; \\mapsto v$ stored in $A$. A standard algorithm for lookup in this case would have constant running time (expressed as function of $n$).\nLoad factor and rehashing # Definition. Let $n$ be the number of entries in the associative array, and let $m$ be the size of $A$. The ratio $\\alpha = \\frac{n}{m}$ is called the load factor of the hash table.\nA high load factor increases the chances of collision, thus affecting performance.\nWhen the load factor becomes too high, the hash table is typically rehashed, meaning that a larger hash table is created (thus with a different hashing function), in which entries are re-inserted.\nFrom Wikipedia, for a chaining hash table, the maximal acceptable load factor is between 1 and 3.\nAverage running time # A good hash function is usually expected to distribute keys evenly across slots.\nIn a chaining hash table, this means that all lists should have length close to the load factor $\\alpha$.\nUniversal hashing refers to using not one, but a collection of hash functions that satisfies certain properties, and randomly selecting one of these functions at runtime.\nThis guarantees that for a fixed set $S \\subset K$ of keys with size $n$, and for a fixed $k \\in S$, the average length of the slot for $k$ is the load factor $\\alpha$.\nIn other words, the average running time of lookup, insertion and deletion is $\\alpha = \\frac{n}{m}$.\nIf we assume that the size $m$ of $A$ is always reasonable for the number $n$ of entries of the associate array, then $\\alpha$ is independent of $n$. So under this assumption, the average running time of lookup, insertion and deletion is constant (i.e. is in $\\Theta(1)$).\nOpen indexing # In a hash table with open indexing, each slot stores at most one entry of the associative array. In case of collision between two entries, one of them is assigned to a free slot.\nThis is achieved via a so-called probing function (from indices to indices), which defines an order over indices. More precisely:\nInsert. When inserting an entry with key $k$, if the slot $A[h(k)]$ is already occupied, then the \u0026ldquo;next\u0026rdquo; free slot is used instead (where \u0026ldquo;next\u0026rdquo; depends on the probing function). Lookup. When searching for the entry with key $k$, the first investigated slot is $A[h(k)]$, then its successor $s$ (according to the probing function), then the successor of $s$, etc., until we reach the entry with key $k$ (if present) or an empty slot. Delete. When deleting a entry, the slot that it was occupying cannot be deleted, because the resulting empty slot may break future searches. Instead, the slot is marked as a so called tombstone, which does not interrupt a search, but can still be used for future insertions. Performance # The (average and worst case) asymptotic costs of these operations are identical to the ones for chained hash tables.\nOpen addressing can be more efficient in practice than chaining, because it is more likely to benefit from caching (since the whole hash table it an array, it is likely to be contiguous in memory).\nA downside is the maximal acceptable load factor, which is (necessarily) $\\le 1$ (from Wikipedia still, between 0.6 and 0.75).\nin Java # Implementation # Java uses chained hash tables internally, with 16 slots by default.\nEach slot points to a linked list by default.\nIf the maximal acceptable load factor is exceeded, then the hash table is rehashed (as expected).\nIn addition, Java uses a maximal load threshold for an individual slot. If this value is exceeded (but the maximal load factor is not), then the linked list for this slot is converted to a red-black tree.\nAssociative array # As we saw in the dedicated section, the interface java.util.Map represents an associative array.\nThe class java.util.HashMap implements the interface as a hash table.\nThe class java.util.LinkedHashMap also implements this interface as a hash table. However, in addition, each entry contains two pointers to its predecessor and successor (if any) in the order of insertion, thus forming a double linked list, independent of the hash table itself. This allows iterating over the entries of a map in a predictable order (precisely, their insertion order), which is not possible with a HashMap.\nWarning. In a LinkedHashMap, overwriting the value of an entry (with the method Map.put) does not affect the order of insertion.\nSet # As we saw in the dedicated section, the interface java.util.Set represents a set.\nThe class java.util.Hashset implements this interface as a hash table, where keys are the elements of the set, and an \u0026ldquo;entry\u0026rdquo; consists of a key only (i.e. has no value).\nThe class java.util.LinkedHashSet also implements this interface as a hash table. It is analogous to LinkedHashMap, i.e. it guarantees that iteration preserves the order of insertion.\nhashCode # In Java, the keys of a Map and the entries of a Set are objects.\nSo a Java hash function must map an object to a hash table slot. Technically, this function is the composition of:\nthe function hashCode, which maps an object to an int, and a proper hash function $h$ that maps this int to a hash table slot. The function hashCode is an instance method of the class Object, thus it is inherited by default by all objects. This function behaves like a pure function, in the sense that it must return twice the same int if it is called twice for the same object. This property must be preserved if the method is overridden.\nThe hash function $h$ is also a function in the mathematical sense. Therefore the composition of these two functions has this property. As a consequence, a same key is always mapped to the same slot.\nhashCode and equals # Warning. In a Java hash table, two keys $o_1$ and $o_2$ are considered equal iff\n$\\qquad o_1$.equals($o_2$)\nreturns true.\nExercise Consider the following Java class City, which overrides the method equals, so that two cities are considered equal iff they have the same name and zip code.\npublic class City(){ String name; int zipCode; public City(String name, int zipCode){ this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipCode; } @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (this == o) { // same reference return true; } if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; // o is null or has a different type } City downcastObject = (City) o; return zipCode == downcastObject.zipCode \u0026amp;\u0026amp; name.equals(downcastObject.name); } Can we predict the output of the following program (and if so, what is it)?\nCity bologna = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100); City bolognaAgain = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100); Set\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; cities = new HashSet(); cities.add(bologna); cities.add(bolognaAgain); System.out.println(cities.size()); Solution The output is unpredictable.\nObserve that the variables bologna and bolognaAgain point to two different objects $o_1$ and $o_2$.\nIn the hash table that stores the set cities:\nthe slot associated to $o_1$ is $i_1 = h$($o_1$.hashCode()), the slot associated to $o_2$ is $i_2 = h$($o_2$.hashCode()). Since $o_1$ and $o_2$ are different objects, $i_1$ and $i_2$ may of may not be identical.\nThe instruction cities.add(bologna) adds a node with key $o_1$ to $A[i_1]$. The instruction cities.add(bolognaAgain) adds a node with key $o_2$ to $A[i_2]$.\nThen the instruction cities.size() returns the number of entries in the hash table.\nIf $i_1 = i_2$ (i.e. if we have a collision), then the method put will not insert $o2$ in the hash table (since $o_1$.equals($o_2$) evaluates to true). Therefore the method cities.size() will return 1,\nIf $i_1 \\neq i_2$, then the method put will insert $o2$ in the hash table (at slot $i_2$). Therefore the method cities.size() will return 2.\nWarning. As show with this exercise, if a class overrides equals without overriding hashCode, then the behavior of the basic operations on hash tables (insertion, lookup and deletion) may depend on collisions.\nThis makes the behavior of several methods implemented by HashMap, LinkedHashMap, HashSet and LinkedHashSet (among others) unpredictable.\nTo avoid this, whenever equals is overridden, hashCode should be overridden accordingly.\nRequirement. For two Java objects $o_1$ and $o_2$,\n$\\qquad$ if $o_1$.equals($o_2$), then hashCode($o_1$) = hashCode($o_2$).\nExample(continued). hashCode could be implemented as follows:\npublic class City(){ ... @Override public int hashCode(){ return name.length + zipCode; } } In the example above, any (pure) function that produces an int out of the values of name and zipCode could in theory be used to implement hashCode in the class City.\nHowever, the choice of this function may affect performance.\nExample(continued). The following implementation of hashCode also complies with the implementation of equals above. However, it has the effect of mapping all keys with type City to the same hash table slot.\npublic class City(){ ... @Override public int hashCode(){ return 1; } } This is why a common practice consists in implementing hashCode in terms of the method hashCode of the selected attributes (and implement the method hashCode of these attributes similarly, in a recursive fashion).\nNote. Most native Java classes (like String, Integer, Boolean, ArrayList, HasSet, etc.) already implement hashCode (in accordance with equals).\nThe utility method Objects.hash takes any number of arguments, and wraps the ones that have primitive types (e.g. int into Integer). It returns an int whose value is a function of the outputs of the respective hashCode methods of the arguments.\nExample(continued). In our example, we can implement hashCode as follows:\npublic class City(){ ... @Override public int hashCode() { return Objects.hash(name, zipCode); } } The returned value depends on the values of name.hashCode() and Integer.valueOf(zipCode).hashCode().\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/docs/env/sections/files/","title":"Hierarchical file system","section":"Development environment","content":" Hierarchical file system # File name extension # File names often end with an extension, which provides information about the type of the file. For instance, the file name myDocument.pdf has .pdf as extension.\nExamples. Common file name extensions include:\n.pdf for a PDF file, .mp3 for an MP3 file, .java for a Java source file, .class for a compiled Java file. Warning. A file name extension is not mandatory, and has no incidence on the content of the file. For instance:\na text file myFile.txt can be renamed myFile.mp3 an still be opened with a text editor, a bash script myScript.sh and the same file without the .sh extension can be executed in the same way, a \u0026ldquo;README\u0026rdquo; file is a text file (written in Markdown), often used to describe the content of a git repository. It can be named either README.md or README. However, appropriate file extensions may be needed for some programs to behave as expected. For instance, an IDE or a code editor may use file extensions (like .java) to identify the programming language at hand.\nTree # Most operating system expose files as a (virtual) tree (or possibly several trees for Windows).\nA (nonempty) tree is either:\na single node (called a leaf), or a node with one or several children that are trees. In this tree, non-leaf nodes are directories, and the leaves can be files, links, empty directories, etc. For instance:\n├── bin │ ├── echo │ └── ... ├── home │ ├── alice │ │ ├── .bashrc │ │ ├── .m2 │ │ │ └── ... │ │ ├── Desktop │ │ │ └── ... │ │ ├── music │ │ │ └── thatSong.mp3 │ │ └── workspace │ │ └── pp │ │ ├── assignments │ │ │ └── ... │ │ └── project │ │ ├── .git │ │ │ └── ... │ │ ├── src │ │ │ └── HelloWorld.java │ │ └── test │ │ └── testHelloWorld.java │ └── bob │ ├── .bashrc │ ├── Desktop │ │ └── ... │ └── music │ ├── thatSong.mp3 │ └── anotherSong.mp3 └── ... Terminology. In this course, we will use the terms \u0026ldquo;folder\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;directory\u0026rdquo; interchangeably.\nTerminology. \u0026ldquo;File\u0026rdquo; is sometimes used (e.g. in the Linux documentation) as a generic term for all nodes in this tree (in combination with \u0026ldquo;directory file\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;executable file\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;regular file\u0026rdquo;, etc.) We will not follow this terminology.\nWindows may expose several trees (e.g. one per physical device).\nPath # Definition. In such a tree, a path from a directory $s$ to an arbitrary node $t$ is either:\n. if $s$ and $t$ are the same node, or .. if $t$ is the parent of $s$, or the name of $t$ if $s$ is the parent of $t$, or a path from $s$ to some node $i$, followed by / (or \\on Windows), followed by a path from $i$ to $t$. For instance (on macOS, Linux, etc.), in the tree above:\nhome/alice/workspace/pp/project/src/HelloWorld.java is a path from the root to the file HelloWorld.java, workspace/pp/project/src/HelloWorld.java is a path from the directory alice to the file HelloWorld.java, ../../bob/Desktop is a path from Alice\u0026rsquo;s Desktop to Bob\u0026rsquo;s Desktop, ../../bob/../bob/./Desktop is another path from Alice\u0026rsquo;s Desktop to Bob\u0026rsquo;s Desktop. Exercise How many paths are there from a directory to a node?\nSolution (Countably) infinitely many.\nCase sensitivity # Warning. Some operating systems (Windows, macOS) use case-insensitive paths, whereas others (Linux, Android) use case-sensitive paths (this may also vary depending on physical storage devices).\nFor instance, on Windows, src/HelloWorld.java and src/helloworld.java are the same path.\nIn order to make sure that your code is portable:\nalways use case-sensitive paths in your code (i.e. respect the names of your files, folders, etc.), do not create two files (or subfolders, etc.) in the same folder with identical names modulo upper/lower case (e.g. Readme.md and README.md). Path separator # As mentioned above, Windows uses \\ as path separator, as opposed to the / used by other OSs (or in web URIs).\nWarning (for Windows). Some programs executed on Windows automatically convert the / path separator into a \\ (or the other way around).\nWarning (for Windows). In Java, a path can be safely written with /. At run time (i.e. when the program is executed), this symbol will be interpreted based on the underlying OS (i.e. as \\ on Windows, and as / on other OSs). However, a path written with \\ will be interpreted as such (therefore the program will throw an exception on OSs other than Windows).\nGood practices # Warning. The following are usually discouraged:\na path separator (/ or \\), a colon (:), a whitespace character or a quotes/backtricks in a file or folder name, a period (.) in a folder name. Your file browser and/or file system may let you to create such names. But these may cause some programs to fail.\nConvention # In what follows (unless explicitly stated), we will adopt by default the conventions for path names adopted on Linux. In particular, we will use / as a separator, and case-sensitive file and folder names.\nAbsolute path # Definition. An absolute path is a path prefixed with:\n/ on macOS, Linux, Android, IOs, etc. a capital letter followed by :\\ on Windows, where the letter identifies a physical device, disk partition, etc. In particular, the identifier of the main partition is often the letter C, in which case absolute paths (within this partition) are prefixed with C:\\. An absolute path is always a path from the root of the tree.\nFor instance (on macOS, Linux, etc.), /home/alice/workspace/pp/project/src/HelloWorld.java is an absolute path to the file HelloWorld.java\nA few simple observations:\ntwo different files may share the same name (but cannot share an absolute path), and two files with the same name may or may not be identical. E.g. in the above example, the two files named thatSong.mp3 may or may not be identical. Relative path # Definition. A relative path is a path that is not absolute.\nFor instance, ../../bob/Desktop is a path to Bob\u0026rsquo;s Desktop relative to Alice\u0026rsquo;s Desktop.\nNote that if p is a relative path, then p prefixed with ./ (or .\\ on Windows) is a path equivalent to p. This prefix is sometimes used to emphasize that a path is relative (among other purposes).\nExercise Complete the table below, based on the tree above.\nabsolute path to source directory $s$ absolute path to target $t$ possible path from $s$ to $t$ /home/alice/Desktop ../../bob/music/anotherSong.mp3 /home/alice/music ./../../../home/../home/alice/music /home/alice /home/alice/music/thatSong.mp3 /home/alice/music /home/bob/music/thatSong.mp3 project alice/../alice/.bashrc Solution absolute path to source directory $s$ absolute path to target $t$ possible path from $s$ to $t$ /home/alice/Desktop /home/bob/music/anotherSong.mp3 ../../bob/music/anotherSong.mp3 /home/alice/music /home/alice/music ./../../../home/../home/alice/music /home/alice /home/alice/music/thatSong.mp3 music/thatSong.mp3 /home/alice/music /home/bob/music/thatSong.mp3 ../../bob/music/thatSong.mp3 /home/alice/workspace/pp /home/alice/workspace/pp/project project /home /home/alice/.bashrc alice/../alice/.bashrc Working directory # Each process (e.g. a process that executes a Java program) has a working directory, which is a directory of the hierarchical file system. This directory may vary depending on the program and/or how it was started.\nMany programs (implicitly) interpret a relative path as relative to their working directory.\nIn particular, this is the case of:\nJava programs, file browsers, shells. Home directory # Each user of a system has its own home directory. E.g. in this example:\n/home/alice/ for Alice /home/bob/ for Bob Warning. The home directory is usually not the root of the tree (even if there is a single user on the machine).\nAbsolute paths to the home directory # The home directory (of a regular user) is normally:\n/home/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on Linux/BSD, /Users/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on macOS, /User/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on iOS, /data/media/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on Android, \u0026lt;mainHardDriveId\u0026gt;:\\Users\\\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on Windows (e.g. C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt;). On Linux and macOS, the alias ~ can be used as an absolute path to the current user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. For instance, in the above example, if Alice is logged in, then ~/music/thatSong.mp3 and /home/alice/music/thatSong.mp3 are two absolute paths to the same file.\nAccess restriction # Files and programs within the home directory of a user can usually be accessed by this user only (or a system admin). Therefore programs that can be executed by all users are usually located in other directories (e.g. the program /bin/echo in the example above).\nAccess restrictions (read, write and/or execute) may apply to the content of such directories. Notably, on Linux systems, (most of) the content of these directories can only be modified by a system admin.\nHidden files and directories # The home directory often contains files (resp. directories) whose names are preceded with a . (e.g. the file /home/alice/.bashrc in the above example). These are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;dot files\u0026rdquo; (resp. \u0026ldquo;dot folders\u0026rdquo;). On Linux and macOS, dot files and dot folder are hidden by default in a terminal or a file browser. On Windows, a (dot or not) file or folder can also be hidden, via a dedicated \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; attribute.\nHidden files and directories may be used to store (user-specific) parameters or options for a program. For instance, the configuration file ~/.gitconfig can be used to declare parameters (e.g. user identifier, etc.) or options (e.g. disable default fast-forward merge, etc.) to be used with git.\nHint. Configuration files are a convenient way to save your personal preferences and use them on several machines. For instance, you may need to connect to a remote server via ssh to perform some tasks (e.g. deploy a database or run costly computations). In such a scenario, you can upload dot files to your home directory on this server.\nHidden files or directories may serve other purposes. For instance, the dot folder ~/.m2 is used by Maven to store (in one place) the Java libraries that are required (as dependencies) by any Java project present in the home directory.\nHidden files or directories may also contain information specific to a subdirectory. For instance, every git repository (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;project\u0026rdquo;) contains a dot folder .git that stores the full history of modification made to the repository.\nUsage and layout # Your home directory is where you generally want to store your projects, documents, scripts, etc.\nYou are free to structure it as you like (using sub-directories). Make sure that this structure allows you to retrieve your own work easily.\nWarning. When you download or create a project/document in your home directory, choose its location.\nDo not let an application decide this location for you. Do not rely exclusively on the \u0026ldquo;recently opened\u0026rdquo; feature of an app to locate your files. Do not store files and project directly at the root of your home directory. Warning. Aside from a few exceptional cases, your home directory should not contain multiple copies of a project or document.\nHint. It can be difficult for a new developer to figure out when to accept the default directory or layout suggested by a program, and when to overwrite it. As a (soft) rule of thumb, you generally want to choose the location of:\na file downloaded from your browser (or mail client), a project created with your IDE, a cloned git repository, a file created with an app, etc. Conversely, it is generally recommended to follow suggestions in the following cases:\ninternal structure of a project (typically the one generated by an IDE): e.g. the standard directory layout for a Maven project, or the standard directory structure of a Node JS project. software installed outside of your home directory, location of dot files and folders, etc. "},{"id":30,"href":"/docs/interfaces/sections/java_interfaces/","title":"Java interfaces","section":"Interfaces","content":" Java interfaces # A Java interface is a programming interface with additional (object-oriented) features.\nSyntactically, a Java interface is similar to a class. But (in its simplest form), it contains no code. Instead, it specifies the behavior of some methods (which are implemented in some classes).\nA Java interface can be used to specify how two components of a system communicate (before the interface is even implemented!).\nExamples # The implementation of our game contains an interface called DisplayManager. This interface specifies how the backend can share with the frontend information to be drawn on screen.\npublic interface DisplayManager { ... /** * Displays the input snapshot on screen, as well as the input message. */ void drawSnapshot(Snapshot snapshot, String message); ... } Note. This description contains no code.\nThe method above takes as argument an object of type Snapshot. A snapshot intuitively contains all the information needed by the fronted to draw the current state of the game on screen (board, active player, stats, etc.).\nSnapshot is itself an interface, which specifies (among others) a method called getSizeOfReinforcement, as follows:\npublic interface Snapshot { ... /** * Returns the number of units that will enter the board if reinforcement * is called for the input player. */ int getSizeOfReinforcement(Player player); ... } Note. The name of an interface can be used as a reference type (similarly to the name of a class). For instance, Snaphost is used above as the type of the first argument of the method drawSnapshot.\nA Java interface acts not only as documentation, but also as a contract : any (non-abstract) class that implements this interface must implement all methods declared in the interface (otherwise the program will not compile).\nSo a (non-abstract) class that implements the interface Snapshot must implement the method getSizeOfReinforcement (or inherit an implementation of this method).\nThe interface Snapshot specifies another method\nBoard getBoard(); which must return an object of type Board. And Board is itself an interface, which specifies the information needed to draw the game board (units, position, etc).\nHere is for instance a fragment of the Board interface:\n/** * Board for an ongoing game. * This is a two-dimensional grid. * * Tile coordinates are natural numbers and start at 0. * The top left tile has coordinates (0,0). */ public interface Board { ... /** * Return the maximum possible index for a column (a.k.a. number of columns -1) */ int getMaxColumnIndex(); /** * Returns the maximum possible index for a row (a.k.a. number of rows -1) */ int getMaxRowIndex(); /** * Returns the unit standing on the tile at the input coordinates, if any. * Throws an exception if the coordinates are out of this board\u0026#39;s boundaries. */ Optional\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; getUnit(int rowIndex, int columnIndex) throws CoordinatesOutOfBoardException; ... } Observe that these interfaces only specify what classes should implement, not how. In other words, these interfaces specifies communication between components, without exposing unnecessary implementation details.\nWhen to use a Java interface? # Technically, Java interfaces are not needed in a project. But they can make collaboration within a team of developers significantly easier. In particular:\nAn interface is a convenient way to expose what is needed to interact with your code, while hiding the details of your implementation. For instance, the method drawSnapshot (mentioned above) can be called to draw a snapshot on screen, without knowing how this method is implemented.\nAs a contract, an interface allows two programmers to work independently, ensuring interoperability between the methods and/or components that they are respectively developing.\nAn interface leaves room for alternative implementations to coexist, which share some functionalities. E.g.:\nalternative game modes in the example above, implementations that are specific to a specific hardware, operating system, \u0026hellip; implementations that offer different guarantees on performances (like the multiple implementations of Java\u0026rsquo;s Collection interface and subinterfaces). Inheritance # An interface in Java can extend another interface, like a class can extend another class, with the same keyword extends.\nHowever, Java interfaces support multiple inheritance (whereas Java classes do not). This means that an interface $A$ can extend two interfaces $B$ and $C$ even if $B$ and $C$ do not extend each other.\nImplementing an interface # In Java, the keyword implements is used to indicate that a class implements an interface. For instance:\npublic class SnapshotImpl implements Snapshot { ... } Note. It is good practice to avoid a class and an interface with the same name (even if they describe the same objects). To differentiate them, you may for instance use the suffix Impl, as illustrated above.\nConsider a class $C$ that implements an interface $I$ :\nif $C$ is abstract, then it can implement some of the methods declared in $I$, if $C$ is not abstract, then each method declared in $I$ must be implemented in $C$ (or some superclass of $C$), otherwise the program will not compile. Exercise The program represented by the following diagram does not compile. Can you see why?\nSolution The class Butterfly does not implement the method sleep.\nNote. In this example, the class Butterfly inherits an implementation of boost (from AbstractUnit), and overrides it. This is not an error.\nSince Java interfaces support multiple inheritance, a Java class can implement several interface that do not extend each other.\nFor instance, the class Unicorn could implement an interface Animal and another interface ImaginaryCreature, even though none of these two interfaces extends the other (not all animals are imaginary, and not all imaginary creatures are animals). This would be declared as follows:\npublic class Unicorn extends MobileUnit implements Animal, ImaginaryCreature { ... } Exercise The program represented by the following diagram does not compile. Can you see why?\nSolution The class Unicorn does not implement the method hide.\nInterfaces vs abstract classes # In theory, Java\u0026rsquo;s interfaces and abstract classes serve different purposes:\nabstract classes are meant to factorize code (i.e. avoid redundant code), whereas interfaces are meant to document code and act as a contract. However, in practice, they have partially overlapping features, which may be confusing.\nIn particular:\nan abstract class can have abstract methods, which behave similarly to interface methods (with the additional constraint that an abstract method must be implemented by at least one subclass). Since Java 8 (2014), interfaces can carry code, in so-called default methods. This feature was introduced for backward compatibility reasons, but arguably contradicts the meaning of the term \u0026ldquo;interface\u0026rdquo;. Note. A benefit of default methods (i.e. methods implemented in interfaces) is that they allow multiple inheritance of implemented methods (since interfaces allow multiple inheritance), which is not possible with classes. For this reason, some authors (like Joshua Bloch) recommend using interfaces with default methods to play the role of abstract classes. However, this may be confusing for less experienced Java developers.\nFor this course, we chose to present Java interfaces from a more traditional (pre-Java 8) perspective, because this is arguably easier to understand, and still the dominant usage of Java interfaces. However, for your project, feel free to deviate from this model if you think that this is appropriate (in particular if you need multiple inheritance).\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/docs/build/sections/layout/","title":"Layout","section":"Build automation","content":" Layout # The standard directory layout # By default, a Maven project is expected to comply with the so-called \u0026ldquo;standard directory layout\u0026rdquo;.\nWarning.

This is called a maven archetype.\nThe target directory # When building a Maven project, some files and directories are generated.\nBy default, the directory called target (at the root of the project) contains the output of the build, in particular:\nthe bytecode (i.e. .class files), the generated .jar file(s), if any.

"},{"id":32,"href":"/docs/recursion/sections/nary/","title":"N-ary recursion","section":"Recursion","content":" N-ary recursion # Definition. A recursive method that is not linear recursive uses n-ary recursion.\nSpecific cases include:\nbinary recursion if a method performs up to two recursive calls each time it is executed, ternary recursion if it performs up to three recursive calls each time it is executed, etc. Examples.\nThe algorithm seen earlier to print all files in a folder uses n-ary recursion.\nAll the binary tree algorithms seen earlier use binary recursion.\nDivide and conquer # The divide-and-conquer paradigm is a variation of the methodology seen earlier to solve a problem recursively. In the divide-and-conquer approach, the smaller inputs $I_1$, .., $I_k$ usually have (nearly) the same size.\nDivide-and-conquer has been instrumental in discovering efficient solutions to pervasive computational problems. Well-known examples include:\nthe Karatsuba algorithm for multiplying two numbers, the Strassen algorithm for matrix product, Mergesort for (stable) sorting. Example: Mergesort # Mergesort is one of (many) algorithms commonly used to sort an array, i.e. to solve the following problem:\nInput: an array $A$\nOutput: a sorted array with the same elements as $A$\nObservation. As we saw already, the array can be of any type (int, String, City, Unit, etc.), and the sorting criterion can be any total preorder over this type.\nThe Mergesort algorithm may be summarized as follows:\n(Base case). If $A$ has size $1$, then return it ($A$ is already sorted). (Inductive case). Otherwise: (divide): partition $A$ into its left half $A_1$ and its right half $A_2$, (solve): sort $A_1$ and sort $A_2$ (recursively), (combine): merge (the sorted versions of) $A_1$ and $A_2$. Here is a naive implementation, in pseudocode:\nWarning. This implementation is suboptimal (some arrays can be reused). We only used it to keep the explanation simple.\n// Returns a sorted array that contains the same elements as A. Type[] mergesort(Type[] A) { // Base case: the input array has size 1, it is already sorted. if(A.length == 1){ return A } // Inductive case (the input array has size \u0026gt; 1) // Compute the middle index (rounded down) int middleIndex = (A.length - 1) / 2 // Copy the left half of A into a new array Type[] leftHalf = copy(A[0 .. middleIndex]) // Sort it leftHalf = mergesort(leftHalf) // Copy the right half of A into a new array Type[] rightHalf = copy(A[middleIndex + 1 .. A.length - 1]) // Sort it rightHalf = mergesort(rightHalf) // merge the two sorted halves return merge(leftHalf, rightHalf) } Exercise To complete this algorithm, implement (in pseudocode) the auxiliary method\nType[] merge(Type[] A, Type[] B) that takes as input two sorted arrays A and B, and returns a sorted array that contains their values.\nTry also to write it in such a way that the overall Mergesort algorithm is stable.\nPossible solution Iterate over A and B in parallel:\nif A[0] (resp. B[0]) is smaller than B[0] (resp. A[0]), then: add A[0] (resp. B[0]) to the output array, and repeat with A[1] and B[0] (resp. A[0] and B[1]), etc. when reaching the end of A (resp. B), add the remaining elements of B (resp. A) to the output array. More precisely:\nType[] merge(Type[] A, Type[] B){ // Output array Type[] C = new Type[A.length + B.length] // Index to iterate over A int a = 0 // Index to iterate over B int b = 0 // Index to iteratate over C int c = 0 // while we have not reached the end of A or B while (a \u0026lt; A.length \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b \u0026lt; B.length) { if(A[a] \u0026lt;= B[b]) { C[c] = A[a] a++ } else { C[c] = B[b] b++ } // If we reached the end of A, if(a == A.length){ // append all remaining elements of B to the output array. append(B, b, C, c) } else // Otherwise we reached the end of B. // So append all remaining elements of A to the output array. append(A, a, C, c) } } append (Type[] D, int d, Type[] C, int c) { while (d \u0026lt; D.length){ C[c] = D[d] d++ } } Merge sort in action. You can find visual illustrations of the execution of merge sort online. For instance this animation, or this (more accurate) one.\nObservation. Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm.\nTree and graph traversal # Earlier in this chapter, we used different algorithms to traverse a binary tree, where nodes were instances of the following class:\nOne of these algorithms was the so-called \u0026ldquo;pre-order traversal\u0026rdquo;:\ntraverse(Node root){ // inductive case only (do nothing in the base case) if (root != null){ print(root.label) traverse(root.leftChild) traverse(root.rightChild) } } This algorithm naturally generalizes to trees where nodes may have more than two children. Nodes in such a tree can be represented as instances of the following class:\nAnd the algorithm becomes:\ntraverse(Node root){ if (root != null){ print(root.label) foreach child in root.children { traverse(child) } } } This algorithm can in turn be adapted to traverse a graph. More precisely, to explore all nodes reachable (directly or transitively) from a given source node in the graph.\nWarning. When applied to a graph, the algorithm above:\nmay not terminate (if the graph contains a loop), may process some nodes multiple times (even if the graph is acyclic). In order to avoid this, a common technique consists in labelling nodes in a graph with an additional boolean attribute visited, which indicates whether a node has already been visited during a traversal:\nAnd the algorithm becomes:\ntraverse(Node root){ if (root != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !root.visited){ root.visited = true print(root.label) foreach child in root.children { traverse(child) } } } Terminology. This approach is often called depth-first exploration of a graph.\nExercise Consider the following graph.\nWhat does the above algorithm print for input node A, assuming that the children of each node are sorted in label\u0026rsquo;s alphabetical order?\nSolution A B D F C E\nMinimax/Maximin # Minimax is a recursive algorithm with applications in games, robotics, decision making, etc.\nMinimax may be easier to explain in the context of a turn-based zero-sum game, i.e. a game (like chess or tic-tac-toe) where players compete with each other (as opposed for instance to a collaborative game).\nZero-sum two player games can be used to model decisions that minimize risk, assuming that the worst will happen if it can. In other words, one the two players represents the decision maker, and the other player represents \u0026ldquo;bad luck\u0026rdquo;.\nNumerous extensions and heuristics have been devise for Minimax. Here we only focus on the algorithm in its basic form.\nWinning strategy # Let Alice and Bob be our two players.\nExercise Consider the following state of a game of tic-tac-toe, where Alice plays with crosses, and is the next person to play.\nAssuming that Alice plays optimally, she already has won the game. Can you see why?\nSolution If Alice plays top right or bottom right, then regardless of Bob\u0026rsquo;s action, she can complete a line or a diagonal as her next move.\nLet us generalize this observation.\nIn a turn-based two player game, a sequence of moves can be viewed as a list of board states, whose head is the initial board state.\nThe tree that consists of all these lists represents all possible sequences of moves from the initial board state.\nExample. In the following tree, the root is a board state (of an imaginary game), and each branch represents a possible sequence of moves. Alice\u0026rsquo;s possible moves are the green edges, and Bob\u0026rsquo;s possible moves are the red edges.\nThe numbers on the leaves represent the payoff for Alice:\n9 if this is a winning state for Alice, and 0 if this is a winning state for Bob. Warning. In such a tree, several nodes may represent the same board state (e.g. in a chess game, where different sequences of moves may lead to the same board state).\nExercise In the tree above, determine whether Alice has already won the game (assuming that she plays optimally).\nSolution The answer is yes, if Alice selects the right child of the tree\u0026rsquo;s root.\nObservation. In both exercises above, we were able to determine that Alice had already won the game, regardless of Bob\u0026rsquo;s actions. Intuitively, this holds iff:\nthere is a move for Alice such that, for every possible move of Bob, there is a move for Alice such that, for every possible move of Bob, \u0026hellip; either: there is a move for Alice that produces a winning state for Alice, or every possible move of Bob produces a winning state for Alice. This observation leads to a natural recursive definition.\nTerminology. In our tree, let us assuming that the root has depth $0$. We call a node existential if its depth is even, and universal if its depth is odd.\nExistential (resp. universal) nodes are the ones where Alice (resp. Bob) plays.\nDefinition. A node $n$ is a winning node (for Alice) if:\nit represents a winning state for Alice, or $n$ is existential and some child of $n$ is a winning node, or $n$ is universal and all children of $n$ are a winning nodes. Naive algorithm # Let us start with a naive algorithm for games where:\nthe height of the tree is finite (as opposed to chess for instance, where there can be infinite sequences of moves). each leaf is a winning state for either Alice or Bob (as opposed to tic-tac-toe for instance, where there can be a draw). In such a game, every node of the tree must be a winning node for Alice or for Bob. In order to determine this, we can intuitively propagate labels up the tree:\nLet us assume that nodes in our tree are instance of the following class Node.\nNotation.\nIf nodes is an array of nodes and f a function that takes a node as argument, we will use:\n$\\qquad$ [ f(n) | n in nodes ]\nfor the array obtained by applying f to each element of nodes.\nObservation. Let n be a non-leaf node whose children have label 0 or 9. Then:\nthere exists a child of n with label 9 iff max [ c.label | c in n.children ] = 9 every child of $n$ is labeled with 9 iff min [ c.label | c in n.children ] = 9 Using this observation and our definition of a winning node (above), we can write the following recursive method maxiMin (in pseudocode). It takes an existential node as input, and returns:\n9 if this node is a winning node for Alice, or 0 if this node is a winning node for Bob. // existential node int maxiMin(Node n){ // base case (leaf node) if(n.children.length == 0){ return n.label } // inductive case: return the largest label computed for a child return max [ miniMax(c) | c in n.children ] } // universal node int miniMax(Node n){ // base case (leaf node) if(n.children.length == 0){ return n.label } // inductive case: return the least label computed for a child return min [ maxiMin(c) | c in n.children ] } In this algorithm, the method miniMax takes a universal node as input, and its return value has the same meaning as maximin (i.e. 9 if the node is a winning node for Alice, or 0 if it is a winning node for Bob).\nNote. The code can be (slightly) factorized by writing a unique recursive method, with an additional boolean argument that indicates whether the input node is existential or universal.\nThis is usually how the algorithm is presented. We used two methods instead for readability.\nApplication # In practice, in order to apply this algorithm to a game, the class Node is unnecessary. Instead, we can use:\nan auxiliary procedure possibleMoves that compute the \u0026ldquo;children of a node\u0026rdquo;, i.e. takes as argument a board state, and enumerates all board states that can be reached from it in one move. an auxiliary procedure score that returns the \u0026ldquo;label of a leaf node\u0026rdquo;. This procedure takes a state as input, and determines whether this state is a winning state for Alice or Bob. The method maximim becomes:\nint maxiMin(State s){ Set\u0026lt;State\u0026gt; children = possibleMoves(s) // base case (leaf node) if(children.size == 0){ return score(s) } // inductive case: return the largest label computed for a child return max [ miniMax(c) | c in children ] } And similarly for miniMax.\nThen Alice can decide her next move by calling miniMax(c) for each successor state c of the current state, and select one of the states with the highest score.\nGeneralization # Arbitrary weights # The Minimax algorithm can be generalized to scenarios where a leaf node may not represent a winning state for Alice or Bob. For instance, in order to model tic-tac-toe, we may label some leaves with the value 4 for a draw.\nMore generally, any function score that assigns a score to a node can be used, as long as it assigns a maximal value to a winning state for Alice, and a minimal value to a winning state for Bob.\nThe algorithm is unchanged.\nLarge or infinite trees # Warning Minimax can be prohibitive for games with an important tree height (since the number of board states to explore may grow exponentially with the height of the tree).\nBesides, Minimax does not terminate if the tree has infinite branches (for instance in a chess game).\nThis is why the tree of game states is usually explored up to a certain depth.\nExample. Deep Blue (the first program that defeated a chess world champion) was only looking 12 moves ahead.\nThe algorithm becomes:\n// existential node int maxiMin(State s, int depth){ Set\u0026lt;State\u0026gt; children = possibleMoves(s) // base case if(children.size == 0 | depth == 0){ return score(s) } // inductive case: return the largest label computed for a child return max [ miniMax(c, depth - 1) | c in children ] } // universal node int miniMax(Node n, int depth){ Set\u0026lt;State\u0026gt; children = possibleMoves(s) // base case if(children.size == 0 | depth == 0){ return score(s) } // inductive case: return the least label computed for a child return min [ maxiMin(c, depth - 1) | c in children ] } Optimization # A variety of optimization techniques have been developed for Minimax. For instance:\nkeeping track of visited board states (recall that different nodes in our tree may represent the same board state), alpha-beta pruning. These are beyond the scope of this course.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/docs/project/sections/board_game/","title":"Option 2: board game","section":"Project","content":" Option 2: board game # The second project option available to you consists in developing a video game with mechanics analogous to the ones of Might \u0026amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes or Legend of Solgard.\nStudents who choose this option you will be provided:\na basic graphical user interface (GUI) that they can reuse and/or customize, examples during lectures that they may adapt to their project.

The project is designed so that:\nyou can develop a fully functional game (player vs player or player vs bot) by focusing exclusively on the backend (i.e. the mechanics of the game), without modifying the GUI. backend and frontend are decoupled. Communication between frontend and backend is specified via Java interfaces. It revolves around the notion of a game snapshot, which contains all the information needed to describe a state of the game (equivalently, you can think of a snapshot as a save state). In particular, snapshots are independent of a specific GUI.\nFor instance, a method is available that allows you to pass a snapshot to the GUI component. When you call this method, the snapshot will be drawn on screen, replacing the previous one (if any).\nAs input, your code receives the next action of the active player (for instance, delete the unit present on a specific tile). These are again specified by an interface, with 7 method that you need to implement. Your implementation should react to each action, i.e. modify the current snapshot, and then send it the GUI component for display.\nThe README.md file (at the root of the project) contains a description of the different components and interfaces, as well as building instructions, and explains where your code could fit. Read it carefully before you start working on your project!\nNote. You are of course free to modify the interfaces that come with the project. But this may require modifying the implementation of the GUI.\nDisclaimer. By design, the project compromises performance for simplicity and modularity.

According to this default implementation, equals behaves like ==.\nCity trento = new City(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38100); City trentoAgain = new City(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38100); Set\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; cities = Set.of(trento, trentoAgain); // Outputs 2 System.out.println(cities.size()); Now consider a class SmartCity identical to City, but that overrides equals (andhashCode) in the standard way:\npublic class SmartCity { String name; int zipCode; public SmartCity(String name, int zipCode) { this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipCode; } @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (this == o) return true; if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; SmartCity smartCity = (SmartCity) o; return zipCode == smartCity.zipCode \u0026amp;\u0026amp; name.equals(smartCity.name); } @Override public int hashCode() { return Objects.hash(name, zipCode); } } A Java Set cannot contain two instances of SmartCity that have the same name and zip code:\nSmartCity smartTrento = new SmartCity(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38100); SmartCity smartTrentoAgain = new SmartCity(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38100); Set\u0026lt;SmartCity\u0026gt; smartCities = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); smartCities.add(smartTrento); smartCities.add(smartTrentoAgain); // Outputs 1 System.out.println(smartCities.size()); // Outputs false System.out.println(smartCities.add(smartTrentoAgain)); Note. Recall that many native Java classes already override equals (and hashCode). Among others: String, boxed types (like Integer), but also most implementations of the Collection interface (including HashSet).\nNote. Some implementations of List also provide methods that perform \u0026ldquo;set-like\u0026rdquo; comparisons. E.g. containsAll, removeAll, retainAll, etc. Again, we refer to the Javadoc for an exhaustive documentation.\nUsage # Implementations of the ADT set can be useful in a variety of contexts. For instance, remove duplicates from an array (assuming that the order of elements in the array is irrelevant):\nInteger[] myArray = new Integer[]{1,2,3,1,2}; List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; tuple = List.of(myArray); Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; set = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(tuple); // Outputs 3 System.out.println(set.size()); Or check whether two lists contain the same (distinct) elements:\nSmartCity mantova = new SmartCity(\u0026#34;Mantua\u0026#34;, 46100); SmartCity bergamo = new SmartCity(\u0026#34;Bergamo\u0026#34;, 24100); List\u0026lt;SmartCity\u0026gt; list1 = List.of(mantova, bergamo); List\u0026lt;SmartCity\u0026gt; list2 = List.of(bergamo, mantova); Set\u0026lt;SmartCity\u0026gt; set1 = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(list1); Set\u0026lt;SmartCity\u0026gt; set2 = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(list2); // Outputs true System.out.println(set1.equals(set2)); Exercise In our game, a same unit may sit on two (or more) adjacent tiles.\nConsider an implementation where:\na board consists of a two-dimensional array with type Unit[][], and if a same unit sits on several tiles, then these tiles contain (a reference to) the same (instance of) Unit, and Unit does not override equals (neither do its sub or superclasses). Write a Java method int countUnits(Unit[][] board) that takes such an array as input, and returns the number of different units on the board.\nFor instance, with the board below as input, the method should return 5.\nPossible solution int countUnits(Unit[][] board) { Set\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); for (Unit[] row : board) { for (Unit unit : row) { if (unit != null) { units.add(unit); } } } return units.size(); } Exercise What does the following program print?\nSet\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; aSet = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; anotherSet = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); aSet.add(1); aSet.add(2); anotherSet.add(1); Set\u0026lt;Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;\u0026gt; aFamily = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); aFamily.add(aSet); aFamily.add(anotherSet); System.out.println(aFamily.size()); anotherSet.add(2); System.out.println(aFamily.size()); Solution 2 and 2.\n"},{"id":38,"href":"/docs/background/sections/set_tuple_map/","title":"Set, tuple, function","section":"Background","content":" Set, tuple, function # Set # A set can be informally viewed as a collection of elements with no duplicate and in no specific order.\nDefinition.

Parallel computation # In this section, we borrow the simple syntax for parallel computation used in the popular textbook Introduction to algorithms.\nThis syntax extends imperative pseudocode with three keywords:\nspawn sync parallel These keywords correspond to primitives that are available (in one form or another) in many programming languages (like Java) or libraries (like OpenMP) that support multithreading.\nspawn and sync # the keyword spawn allows the current thread to create a child thread and execute an instruction (possibly a method call) in this child thread, as follows: $\\qquad$ spawn \u0026lt;myInstruction\u0026gt;\nthe keyword sync forces the current thread to pause its execution, until all the threads that it has spawned have terminated. Example. The following method:\ntakes as arguments two vectors with integer values, computes the sum of the values of each vector, and returns the sum of the two results. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 int aggregate (int[] v1, int[] v2){ int s1 = spawn sumElts(v1) int s2 = sumElts(v2) print(\u0026#34;waiting\u0026#34;) sync return s1 + s2 } int sumElts(int[] v){ int sum = 0 for(int i = 0; i \u0026lt; v.length; i++){ sum += v[i] } print(\u0026#34;done\u0026#34;) return sum } In this method:\nthe statement spawn sumElts(v1) creates a child thread $c$ and executes the auxiliary method sumElts (with argument v1) in this child thread. the statement sync forces the main thread $m$ to wait for termination of $c$. The child thread $c$ must finish executing the method sumElts before Line 10 is executed by $m$. But there is no other guarantee on when $c$ will finish its task.\nIf $c$ finishes after $m$ executes Line 7, then the program will output:\ndone waiting done If $c$ finishes before $m$ executes Line 7, then the program will output:\ndone done waiting Note that in this latter case, the first \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo; message may be output by any of the two threads.\nparallel # The keyword parallel is associated to a loop. Intuitively, it allows the environment to execute iterations of this loop in different threads (for instance, the library OpenMP provides such a keyword).\nThe (abstract) syntax is the following:\nfor parallel (\u0026lt;myIterationCondition\u0026gt;){ \u0026lt;myLoopBody\u0026gt; } Example. We can parallelize the auxiliary method sumElts in our previous example by adding the keyword parallel to the loop:\nint sumElts(int[] v){ int sum = 0 for parallel (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; v.length; i++){ sum += v[i] } return sum } The keyword parallel can be replaced with combinations of spawn and (if needed) sync.\nExample. The example that immediately precedes can be rewritten as follows (among other options):\nint sumElts(int[] v){ sumRec(v, 0, v.length - 1) } int sumRec(int[] v, int i, int max){ // base case if(i = max){ return v[i] } // inductive case. // compute the middle index int mid = (i + max) / 2 // recursive call on the left half, in a separate thread int leftSum = spawn sumRec(v, i, mid) // recursive call on the right half (in the current thread) int rightSum = sumRec(v, mid + 1, max) sync return leftSum + rightSum } Definition. The span of a program\u0026rsquo;s execution is the maximal number of instructions that it has to perform sequentially.\nExercise Let $f(n)$ measure the span of the program above, where $n$ is the size of the input vector.\nAssuming a number of cores $\\ge n$, which asymptotic class of cost functions does $f$ belong to?\nSolution $f$ is in $\\Theta(\\log n)$\nNote. In this example, it may be tempting to spawn the threads sequentially, rather than recursively. However, the benefit of parallelization is lost:\nint sumElts(int[] v){ int sum = 0 for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; v.length; i++){ spawn sum += v[i] sync } return sum } in Java # Creating a thread # A thread in Java is an instance of the class java.lang.Thread.\nThere are many alternative syntaxes to create an instance of this class. We cover here two of the most common ones.\nInstantiate Runnable # The constructor Thread(Runnable runnable) takes as input an instance of the interface Runnable.\nRunnable is a functional interface, whose method is called run and has type\n$\\qquad$ void $\\to$ void\nTherefore it can be instantiated with a callback method (that takes no argument and returns no value).\nExample.\nThread myThread = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); } ); Alternatively, we can create a class that implements Runnable. This is useful if the child thread needs to access variables that are not effectively final.\nExample.\npublic class MyRunnable implements Runnable { private int arg; public MyRunnable(int arg){ this.arg = arg; } @Override public void run() { System.out.println(arg); } } $\\qquad$\nint myInt = 2; myInt++; Thread myThread = new Thread(new MyRunnable(myInt)); Create a subclass of Thread # Instead of instantiating Runnable, we can create a subclass of Thread and instantiate it.\npublic class MyThread extends Thread { int arg; public MyThread(int arg){ this.arg = arg; } @Override public void run() { System.out.println(arg); } } int myInt = 2; myInt++; Thread myThread = new MyThread(myInt); An advantage of this approach (compared to the previous one) is that we do not need to create an instance of Runnable. A drawback is that the class MyThread cannot extend another class (since Java does not support multiple inheritance). Spawning a thread # The instance method Thread.start spawns a thread (analogously to the spawn keyword in our abstract model).\nExample.\nThread myThread = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); } ); myThread.start(); Waiting for a thread to terminate # Java provides a functionality analogous to the sync keyword seen above, but with more fine-grained control. Calling the Thread instance method $c$.join() for a child thread $c$ causes the current (a.k.a. parent) thread to pause its execution until termination of $c$,\nIn contrast, the sync keyword causes the current thread to wait for termination of all its children.\nThread childThread = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); } ); childThread.start(); ... try { // wait for the spawned thread to terminate childThread.join() } catch (InterruptedException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;Job done, resuming execution\u0026#34;); Loop # In Java, an operation analogous to the parallel keyword is the instance method Stream.parallel that we saw in the dedicated section\nExample.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; vector = getVector(); vector.stream() .parallel() .filter(...) .map(...) .forEach(...); In this case, the whole stream pipeline is executed in a concurrent fashion (possibly parallel if some cores are available).\nBy default, a pool of threads of size $k - 1$ is used, where $k$ is the number of cores of the CPU (but a larger pool can be manually configured).\nPause # The static method Thread.sleep can be used to pause the current thread for a certain amount of time.\nExample.\nSystem.out.ptinln(\u0026#34;Going to sleep...\u0026#34;); // sleep for 4 seconds Thread.sleep(4000); System.out.ptinln(\u0026#34;Waking up\u0026#34;); Warning. The method Thread.sleep does not guarantee that the input sleeping duration is precisely enforced.

For instance, you may create a (private) git repository for each course that you follow and/or each project that you start. Several providers (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.) can host copies of your (public or private) repositories on the cloud for free.\nThe benefits are:\nthe possibility to recover any previous state of your work (a git repository stores the whole history of modifications made to it), fine-grained control over your backup: for instance, you can use a \u0026quot;.gitignore\u0026quot; file to exclude files or subfolder that do not need to be backed up. Note. If a git repository is a subfolder of another git repository, then the inner repository is not included in the history of the outer one.\nLimitation. Git is not suited to large volumes of data (more than 1 GB in the same repository). This is usually not an issue for your own work (code, notes, reports, etc.) as a student in computer science.

A BST is a binary tree such that each node\u0026rsquo;s label is:\nlarger than its left child\u0026rsquo;s label (if any), and smaller than its right child\u0026rsquo;s label (if any). Equivalently, a BST is a binary tree whose nodes are sorted w.r.t. in-order traversal.\nAssociative array as a binary search tree # Recall that an associative array is a finite set of key-value pairs. Again, let us assume keys have type $K$, and that values have type $V$.\nWhen a BST implements an associative array:\neach node of the tree stores a key-value pair, nodes are sorted by key, using their natural order or any other total order over $K$. Lookup # Recall that the lookup operation for an associative array:\ntakes as input a key $k$, and returns the value $v$ associated to this key (if any). Over a BST, this operation is similar to performing a binary search in a sorted array:\nIf the tree is empty, then it (trivially) does not contain an entry with key $k$.\nOtherwise, compare $k$ with the label $l$ of the tree\u0026rsquo;s root:\nif $k = l$, then return the value stored in the root, if $k \u0026lt; l$, then repeat over the left subtree, if $k \u0026gt; l$, then repeat over the right subtree.

Besides, any total order can be used for this purpose (e.g. alphabetical order if the keys are strings).\nSelf balancing trees # A self balancing tree is a specific type of BSTm which guarantees that the tree remains balanced after an insertion or deletion, meaning that its height remains logarithmic in the number of nodes.\nTwo widely used types of self balancing trees are red-black trees and AVL trees.\nin Java # The class java.util.TreeMap implements the interface java.util.Map as a red-black-tree.\nThe class java.util.TreeSet implements the interface java.util.Set as a red-black-tree.\nBy default, keys are sorted according to their natural order.

The method is correct for the smallest possible inputs.\n(Inductive case). For an arbitrary $n$:\n$\\qquad\\qquad$ if the method is correct for all inputs of size $\\leq n$, then it is correct for all inputs of size $n+1$.\nExample. Consider the algorithm seen earlier to compute the sum of all nodes in a binary tree, if nodes are instance of the following class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 int sum(Node root){ // base case if (root == null){ return 0 } // inductive case return root.value + sum(root.leftChild) + sum(root.rightChild) } For the size $n$ of the input, we can use in this example the height of the tree (i.e. the length of its longest branch).\nLet use verify that our two properties hold:\n(Base case). The sum of all labels in an empty tree is 0, so the method is trivially correct.\n(Inductive case). Consider any natural number $n$, and any tree of height $n+1$, with root $r$. And let us assume that the method sum is correct for all trees of height $\\le n$. We need to show that under this assumption, the method is correct for the tree rooted in $r$.\nObserve that the subtrees rooted in r.left and r.right have height $\\le n$. So from our assumption, the two recursive calls (Line 6) to the method sum are correct, meaning that they return the sum of all values in each of the two subtrees. Next, observe that the sum of all labels in our tree must be equal to the sum of all values in these two subtrees, plus the label of $r$. Which is precisely what the method returns. These two properties (1 and 2 above) provide an immediate proof by induction that the method is correct for all inputs.\nProof. Partition the set of all possible inputs by size, i.e. (assuming that inputs in our base case have size 0):\nthe set $S_0$ of all inputs of size $0$, the set $S_1$ of all inputs of size $1$, the set $S_2$ of all inputs of size $2$, etc. In order to show that the method is correct, it is sufficient to show that it is correct for each $S_i$ (where $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$).\nNow let us assume that properties 1 and 2 hold, i.e.:\n(Base case). The method is correct for $S_0$. (Inductive case). For any $n$, $\\qquad\\qquad$ if the method is correct for $S_0 \\cup S_1 \\cup \u0026hellip; \\cup S_n$, then it is correct for $S_{n+1}$.\nWe know that Property 2 holds for an arbitrary $n$. In particular, it holds for $n= 0$. In other words (replacing $n$ with $0$):\nIf the method is correct for $S_0$, then it is correct for $S_1$. So from Properties 1 and 3, we can infer:\nThe method is correct for $S_1$.\n$\\qquad$\nNext, consider the case where $n = 1$. From Property 2 still, we know (replacing $n$ with $1$) that:\nIf the method is correct for $S_0 \\cup S_1$, then it is correct for $S_2$. So from Properties 1 and 4 and 5, we can infer:\nThe method is correct for $S_2$.\n$\\qquad$\netc.\n"},{"id":50,"href":"/docs/labs/env/sections/git_default_te/","title":"Default text editor for git","section":"First lab","content":" Default text editor for git # Some git commands open a text editor to let you type a message.

In the exercise above, Integer extends RationalNumber and RationalNumber extends RealNumber, therefore Integer extends RealNumber.\nAntisymmetry # If $A$ extends $B$ and $B$ extends $A$, then they are the same class.\nExample. In the exercise above, Set and UnionOfSets are (arguably) the same class.\nInheritance # Naturally, if $A$ extends $B$, then it inherits the properties of $B$.\nFor instance, a rectangle has four right angles. Since every square is a rectangle, a square has four right angles as well.\nFactorizing code with a (possibly abstract) superclass # Inheritance can be used to avoid redundant code.\nDirect inheritance: illustration # Let us model the units of our game as objects.\nEach unit has:\na type (e.g. mage, unicorn, etc.), a color (at least in the original game), and a certain amount of health. The behavior and stats of a unit (e.g. number of turns before attacking when combined, default health, etc.) are dictated by its type. So it makes sense to group units by type.\nFor instance, one can create a class Unicorn whose instances are all units of type unicorn. In Java:\npublic class Unicorn { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Unicorn(String color) { this.color = color; health = 1; attackCountdown = -1; } } Note. We used the keyword attackCountdown in this example to indicate the number of turns before the unit attacks (and a special value of -1 when it is not set to attack). But there are of course other ways to model this.\nNote. In this example, we used the prefix this. for the attribute color only, because there is no ambiguity for the two other attributes.\nWe can also create a class Butterfly on the same model\npublic class Butterfly { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Butterfly(String color) { this.color = color; health = 2; int attackCountdown = -1; } } Now consider a method encounter that manages an encounter between two units. Without inheritance, one would need to implement at least three versions of this method (possibly four if encounters are asymmetric):\nunicorn vs unicorn, unicorn vs butterfly and butterfly vs butterfly. For instance, the first of these three methods could be implemented as follows:\nvoid encounter(Unicorn u1, Unicorn u2) { // subtract the health of u2 from the health of u1 u1.health -= u2.health; // the health of u2 becomes the inverse of the remaining health of u1 u2.health = -u1.health; } More generally, if the game has $n$ types of units, then the code will contain $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n$ nearly identical encounter methods.\nQuestion. Can we use inheritance in this example to avoid duplicate code (and how)?\nObserve that a unicorn and a butterfly (viewed as object) have identical attributes (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo;), namely String color, int health, and int attackCountdown. So we can create a superclass of Unicorn and Butterfly that carries these attributes, and let the two subclasses inherit it. For instance, this superclass may be called Unit.\nWe may also want every unit in the game to have a concrete type (like \u0026ldquo;unicorn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;butterfly\u0026rdquo;), rather than being a generic \u0026ldquo;unit\u0026rdquo;. In Java, this can be achieved with the abstract keyword. This keyword ensures that our superclass cannot be directly instantiated (even though it can still have a constructor). For instance:\npublic abstract class Unit { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Unit(String color, int health) { this.color = color; this.health = health; int attackCountdown = -1; } } Because this class is abstract, the following code will not compile:\nUnit myUnit = new Unit(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, 2); Next, we can declare that Unicorn extends Unit, by using the Java keyword extends. We can also use the constructor of Unit within the constructor of Unicorn, with the Java keyword super.\nThis yields:\npublic class Unicorn extends Unit { public Unicorn(String color) { super(color, 1); } } And we can proceed similarly for the class Butterfly:\npublic class Butterfly extends Unit { public Butterfly(String color) { super(color, 2); } } Note. In Java (as opposed to C++ for instance), a class can only have one immediate superclass, so the keyword super is never ambiguous.\nObserve that all the attributes are now carried by the superclass Unit. However, because they are inherited, these attributes can be accessed as if they were regular attributes of the subclass. For instance,\nUnicorn myUnit = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); System.out.println(myUnit.health); outputs\n1 This allows us to write a generic encounter method, as follows:\nvoid encounter(Unit u1, Unit u2) { u1.health -= u2.health; u2.health = -u1.health; } And this method can be called with unicorns and/or butterflies as inputs. For instance:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;); encounter(myUnicorn, myButterfly); } Transitive inheritance # In the example above, we assumed that all units have a color and can attack. What if we also want to create a type of unit called Wall that has no color and cannot attack? An instance of this class does not need the attributes color and attackCountdown.\nA quick solution here consists is setting attackCountdown to -1, and color to null. However, unnecessary attributes make code harder to understand, and such a design may not scale well if the game is extended with more units types.\nExercise Modify our model to accommodate for the class Wall, so that an instance of Wall only has the health attribute, with (default) value 5.\nPossible solution One solution (among others) is the following:\nmodify the class Unit so that it only carries the attribute health, Wall extends Unit, create an (abstract) subclass of Unit (for instance MobileUnit) that carries the other two attributes, Butterfly and Unicorn extend MobileUnit (therefore they also extend Unit, by transitivity). Or in Java:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; public Unit(int health) { this.health = health; } } public class Wall extends Unit { public Wall() { super(5); } } public abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { String color; int attackCountdown; public MobileUnit(String color, int health) { super(health); this.color = color; this.attackCountdown = -1; } } public class Unicorn extends MobileUnit { public Unicorn(String color) { super(color, 1); } } and similarly for Butterfly.\n"},{"id":53,"href":"/docs/labs/env/sections/install/","title":"Installing software","section":"First lab","content":" Installing software # In order to install, update and remove programming-related software (compilers, interpreters, execution environment, libraries, build automation tools, git, maven, etc.), we highly recommend using a package manager.

As a result, when we write a program that uses a generic type (e.g. a native Java Collection), we need to make sure that our code complies with these type constraints.\nIn some situations, this requires reasoning about types and their hierarchy (notably for programs that use callback methods).\nIn this section, we briefly illustrate how the notion of a subtype extends to functions (and more generally, methods). This will allow us to understand (in the dedicated section) some type constraints expressed via generics in languages like Java or C#.\nThe subtype relation # Intuitively, $A$ is a subtype of $B$ if \u0026ldquo;every $A$ is a $B$\u0026rdquo;.\nExamples.\nInteger is a subtype of Number, String is a subtype of Object. In object-oriented programming, subtyping generalizes hierarchical relations between classes, interfaces, etc.\nExample. In Java, $A$ is a subtype of $B$ if:\n$A$ and $B$ are classes and $A$ extends $B$ (directly or transitively), or $A$ and $B$ are interfaces and $A$ extends $B$ (directly or transitively), or $A$ is a class, $B$ is an interface and $A$ implements $B$ (directly or transitively), or etc. Observation. \u0026ldquo;Subtype\u0026rdquo; is a binary relation.

If an object $o$ has type $A$ and $A$ is a subtype of $B$, then $o$ also has type $B$.\nExamples. In Java:\nif an object has type Integer, then it also has type Number, if an object has type String, then it also has type Object. Question. How do these observations generalize to methods and the type of their arguments and return value?\nFor simplicity, we will first use mathematical functions as an analogy.\nDomain, codomain and set inclusion # Reminder.

For instance, consider the following method, which is not an instance method. It verifies whether two instance of MobileUnit have the same color:\npublic boolean sameColor(MobileUnit u1, MobileUnit u2){ return u1.color.equals(u2.color); } This method may be called as follows:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); boolean sameColor = sameColor(myUnicorn, myButterfly); Instead, one may write an equivalent method, as an instance method of our class MobileUnit, with one less argument:\npublic abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { String color; ... public boolean sameColorAs(MobileUnit otherUnit){ return color.equals(otherUnit.color); } } and we can call this method as follows:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); boolean sameColor = myUnicorn.sameColorAs(myButterfly); } Overriding # A same instance method can be declared in a class $C$ and a subclass $S$ or $C$. In this case, we say that $S$ overrides the method (we also say that the method of $S$ overrides the method of $C$).\nWhen such a method is called, the most specific applicable version is executed.\nFor instance, let us extend our example from the previous section with an instance method regen, declared in both Unit and MobileUnit, as follows:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; ... public void regen(){ if(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } } } public abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { ... public void regen(){ if(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } health += 1; } } Now consider this program:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); myUnicorn.regen(); This program increases the health of (the object referenced by) myUnicorn by 2, because Unicorn is a subclass of MobileUnit. However, the following program increases the health of (the object referenced by) myWall by 1, because Wall is a subclass of Unit, but not a subclass of MobileUnit.\nWall myWall = new Wall(); myWall.regen(); Hint. In Java, you can use the annotation @Override to indicate that a method overrides another, as follows:\npublic abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { ... @Override public void regen(){ if(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } health += 1; } } This is not necessary. The benefit is that the program will not compile if the overridden and overriding methods have different signatures.\nMore generally, it is good practice to use features of a language that prevent compilation of incorrect programs. The reason is that syntactic mistakes (a.k.a. compile time errors) are easier to fix than bugs (a.k.a. runtime errors). This is why debugging in an untyped language (like Python, Javascript, Lua, etc.) can be more difficult than in a typed one (such as Java, C#, Typescript, etc.).\nDynamic dispatch (a.k.a. runtime polymorphism) # Dynamic dispatch consists in determining which version of a method must be called when a program is executed (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;at run time\u0026rdquo;), when this cannot be determined by analyzing the program alone. This is a feature of most (class-based) object-oriented languages.\nFor instance, in our example, assume a method generateRandomUnits that generates a random array of units (butterflies, unicorns or walls). And let us call the method regen for each unit in this array:\nUnit[] ramdomUnits = generateRandomUnits(); for (Unit unit: randomUnits){ unit.regen(); } The most specific applicable version of the method regen will be executed for each unit, based on its type, even though this type cannot be determined at compile time. For instance, if there is an instance of Unicorn in this array, then the method MobileUnit.regen() will be executed for this instance (rather than the method Unit.regen()).\nNote that this also applies to scenarios where the type of a variable depends on the input of the program.\nCode factorization # An overriding method often extends the functionality of the overridden one. This is a possible source of duplicate code. For instance, in the example above, both implementations of regen() contain:\nif(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } A common way to factorize this consists in calling the overridden method inside the overriding one. In Java, the keyword super allows us to distinguish the two methods (since they have the same name). For instance, in the above example, the overriding method may be better written as follows:\npublic abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { ... @Override public void regen() { super.regen(); health += 1; } } Exercise In this example, what would be the effect of replacing super.regen() with regen()?\nSolution The method would not terminate.\nExercise Consider the method encounter of the previous section. Add it as an instance method to our example, so that:\nthe method now distinguishes the attacker from the defender, a wall cannot attack, a unicorn gets a regen if it defends. Possible solution The trick here consists in viewing an encounter from the point of view of the defender:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; ... public void defend(MobileUnit attacker) { // subtract the health of the attacker from the health of the current unit health -= attacker.health; // the health of the attacket becomes the inverse of the remaining health of the current unit attacker.health = -health; // some code that makes the encounter asymmetric (attacker and defender are treated differently) ... } } public class Unicorn extends Unit { ... @Override public void defend(MobileUnit attacker) { regen(); super.defend(attacker); } } "},{"id":64,"href":"/docs/interfaces/","title":"Interfaces","section":"Docs","content":" Interfaces # The term interface is used to refer to a variety of artifacts.

For instance:\nif Alice sends a message to Bob, then she has to use a language that Bob understands, if Alice uses git via command-line, then she has to use a command that git recognizes as a possible input, if a program calls git, then it also has to use a command that git recognizes as a possible input, etc. Warning.

A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program may vary depending on the order in which two threads access a resource.\nIllustrations # Example. The following program (in pseudocode) apparently increments variable i twice. However, it may output either 1 or 2, depending on the execution environment:\nint i = 0 spawn i++ i++ sync print(i) The reason is that a core does not increment the value of a variable as an atomic operation. Instead, an increment is a sequence of three instructions:\nread the value of i and fetch it to one of the core\u0026rsquo;s registers increment the value of this register write the register\u0026rsquo;s value back to memory If the two threads are executed in parallel (i.e. on different cores), or if a context switch occurs during the execution of these three operations, then the outcome may be unexpected. Among other possibilities, the following may happen:\nthe current thread executes step 1, copying the value 0 from memory to a register, then the child thread executes step 1 as well, copying the value 0 to another register, then the current thread executes steps 2 and 3, writing the value 1 back to memory, then the child thread executes step 2 and 3, writing the value 1 back again to memory.

Dependency patterns that may occur include:\nco-dependencies:\nFor instance, consider the following configuration:\nProject $P$ depends on a certain version of Library $L_1$, $P$ also depends on Library $L_2$, which depends on an older version of $L_1$ (and the two versions are not compatible), The build of project $P$ may fail because it can contain only one version of $L_1$.\ncyclic dependencies:\nLibrary $L_1$ depends on a specific version of Library $L_2$, and\n$L_2$ depends on a specific version of $L_1$.\nUpgrading one of these two libraries independently may prevent the other one to run. But it may be possible to upgrade both at the same time.\netc.\nNote that in these two examples, dependencies may be direct or transitive. As a result, it can be very difficult to diagnose such problems.\nThe term dependency hell is sometimes used to refer to such situations.\nTwo (non-exclusive) broad approaches are commonly adopted to avoid such issues:\nautomated dependency management (using a package manager), and self-containment: avoid shared libraries, each program having a copy (some of) its own dependencies. Automated dependency management # Definitions # A package is a program together with some metadata. These metadata include the program\u0026rsquo;s name, version, release date, authors, licence and the names of its dependencies (together with their versions).\nA software repository is a collection of packages that comply to the same format of metadata. A software repository (precisely, multiple copies of it) is generally hosted on the cloud.\nA package manager automates the installation (as well as configuration, update and removal) of packages from a software repository (or several) to a user\u0026rsquo;s machine.\nExamples # An operating system (OS) may use a package manager and software repositories. Notably, this is the preferred way of installing software on most Linux distributions. Widely used OS package managers include:\napt for Debian and derivatives, dnf for Fedora and derivatives, pacman for Arch and derivatives, Homebrew for macOS, Chocolatey (since 2011) and Winget (since May 2021) for Windows. Many programming languages have dedicated package managers. For instance:\nMaven for Java, npm for Node.js (Javascript) pip for Python, NuGet for .NET (C#, F#, and Visual Basic) RubyGems for Ruby, CPAN for Perl CRAN for R, etc. Some applications also have dedicated software repositories for plugins (and plugin managers to handle these plugins). For instance.\nThe VSCode market place, CTAN for LateX, MELPA for Emacs, etc. Other applications (such as zsh, vim or neovim) only have plugin managers, without a centralized software repository. These managers install plugins directly from hosts (e.g. GitHub repositories).\nUsage # Installing, updating and removing software via a package manager is highly recommended in most scenarios. In particular:\ndependencies of a package are also installed (or it some cases updated or removed) transitively, some package managers can install and manage several versions of the same package (when needed), the installation process often uses a default configuration and directory layout (environment variables, etc.) that facilitates interaction with other programs. The installation (or update or removal) procedure is also significantly simpler, thus leaving less room for manual errors. As an illustration, here is the full procedure to install Maven with the apt package manager (on Debian and derivatives):\napt install maven and similarly with Homebrew (on macOS):\nbrew install maven or with Chocolatey (on Windows):\nchoco install maven In comparison, the procedure to install Maven manually on Windows is more involved, thus more likely to introduce errors (trough inadvertence, or by following outdated instructions).\nWarning (on Windows). The default and/or most frequent software installation instructions found on the web for Windows are typically manual. For most programming related software, we recommend instead looking for a corresponding package on Chocolatey (or Winget).\nAs a (rather extreme) example, compare installing MinGW (to get the GCC compiler) with:\nthis long procedure, or a simple command (with Chocolatey): choco install mingw However, in some (rare) scenarios, a manual installation may be preferred. In particular when the latest version of a program is needed, but not available yet on the software repository.\nSelf-containment # A variety of strategies can be adopted to build a program so that it runs in partial isolation from the rest of the system that it is deployed on (i.e. in its own environment, and with its own dependencies, that cannot be used by other programs).\nFor instance, a Node.js project often includes a copy of all the Javascript libraries that it depends on (transitively). Further self-containment strategies may involve different levels of virtualization (e.g. via Docker).\nThis is one way to avoid shared dependencies. Other benefits are increased portability, and ease of installation by end-users. Drawbacks include and increased workload on the developer\u0026rsquo;s side (e.g. for maintenance), and limited opportunities for integration with other programs.\nSelf-containment in Java # In Java, self-containment is usually less pronounced during development. Java libraries are typically managed via Maven:\non a per-user basis (which can be viewed as a compromise between per-project and system-wise): each user has a hidden folder \u0026lt;homeDir\u0026gt;/.m2/ that contains all Java libraries used in his/her projects, and allowing multiple versions of the same library to coexist. However, a Java application that targets non-developers can be released together with its Java dependencies, as a so-called über jar (a.k.a. fat jar).\n"},{"id":70,"href":"/docs/abstractdatatypes/sections/queue/","title":"Stack, queue, priority queue","section":"Abstract data types","content":" Stack, queue, priority queue # Some abstract data types impose strong limitations on the set of operations allowed on a collection.

In particular, two threads may compete to access a same resource (e.g. the value of some object\u0026rsquo;s attribute), without guarantee on the order in which they access it. This may lead (among other things) to a race condition\nProgramming languages that support multithreading also allow expressing constraints on the order of execution of some instructions. For instance, we saw earlier that a thread can be forced to wait for a child thread to terminate before resuming its execution.\nIn this section, we review two additional mechanisms (mutual exclusion and condition variables) that allow synchronizing the behaviors of threads.\nFor a more exhaustive overview of the possibilities offered by Java in that regard, we refer to the Javadoc of the package java.util.concurrent. In particular, it summarizes the situations where a Java statement must be executed before another (in Java\u0026rsquo;s terminology, this binary relation over statements is called the \u0026ldquo;happens before\u0026rdquo; relation).\nMutual exclusion # Mutual exclusion prevents two threads to access a same resource concurrently. This is generally achieved via some kind of lock (sometimes called a mutex or semaphore).\nMost programming languages that support concurrency provide mechanisms for mutual exclusion. These languages include C/C++, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, or Rust.\nin Java # Java associates to each object a so-called intrinsic lock (also called monitor lock or simply monitor).\nIf a thread $t_1$ acquires the intrinsic lock of an object, then a different thread $t_2$ cannot acquire this lock until $t_1$ has released it (however, a thread can reacquire a lock that it already owns).\nThe Java keyword synchronized enforces mutual exclusion via an intrinsic lock. In can be used in two ways:\nSynchronized statement # A synchronized statement associates an object $o$ to a block of code (called a synchronized block).\nA thread that enters this block acquires the intrinsic lock of $o$, and releases it when exits the block.\nThe syntax is the following:\nsynchronized(\u0026lt;object\u0026gt;){ \u0026lt;code block\u0026gt; } Example. Consider the two following classes:\npublic class Counter { int value; public Counter(int value){ this.value = value; } } public class Lock { } The method increment below uses an instance of Lock to ensure that a counter is only incremented by one thread at a time:\nvoid increment(Counter counter, Lock lock){ synchronized(lock){ counter.value++; } } As a result, the following program is free of race condition:\nCounter counter = new Counter(0); Lock lock = new Lock(); Thread t1 = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { increment(counter, lock); } ); Thread t2 = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { increment(counter, lock); } ); t1.start(); t2.start(); Observe that in the example above, any object could be used as a lock. In particular, the object counter itself. So the program below is equivalent:\nvoid increment(Counter counter){ synchronized(counter){ counter.value++; } } Counter counter = new Counter(0); Thread t1 = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { increment(counter); } ); Thread t2 = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { increment(counter); } ); t1.start(); t2.start(); Synchronized method # A synchronized instance method uses the intrinsic lock of the object for which this method is called.\nThe syntax is the following:\npublic synchronized int myMethod() { ... } In other words, the two following classes are equivalent:\npublic class MyClass { synchronized int myMethod(){ \u0026lt;method body\u0026gt; } } public class MyClass { int myMethod(){ synchronized(this){ \u0026lt;method body\u0026gt; } } } Warning. A constructor cannot be synchronized (the program will not compile).\nObservation. Let $m$ be a synchronized instance method, let $o$ be an object, let $t_1$ and $t_2$ be two different threads, and let us assume that $t_1$ executes $o.m$ (i.e. $t_1$ executes the method $m$ for the object $o$).\nThen $t_2$ cannot execute any synchronized method for $o$ before the termination of $o.m$ (since $t_1$ acquired the lock on the object $o$).\nObservation. We mentioned above that a thread can reacquire a lock that it already owns.\nAs a consequence, for the same object, a synchronized method can call another, as long as they are executed by the same thread.\nExercise What are the possible outputs of the following program?\nAnd what would these possible outputs be if the method getValue() were not synchronized?\nCan the value 3 be printed, and if so, in which precise scenario(s)?\npublic class Counter { int value; public Counter(int value){ this.value = value; } synchronized void inc(int delta){ value += delta; } synchronized void doubleDec(int delta){ value -= delta; value -= delta; } synchronized int getValue(){ return value; } } Counter counter = new Counter(0); Thread t1 = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { counter.doubleDec(2); } ); t1.start(); Thread t2 = new Thread( () -\u0026gt; { counter.inc(5); } ); t2.start(); System.out.println(counter.getValue()); try { t1.join(); t2.join(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } System.out.println(counter.getValue()); Solution Because the two methods inc and doubleDec are synchronized (and are called for the same object), their executions cannot interleave. This rules out race conditions, so the second print statement must output 1.\nAs for the first print statement, observe that:\nthere is no guarantee on the order of execution of counter.inc(5), counter.doubleDec(2) and the first call to counter.getvalue(). the method getValue() is synchronized, so it cannot be called during the execution of counter.doubleDec(2). So the possible output values here are -4, 0, 1 and 5.\nIf the method getValue() were not synchronized, then it could be called during the execution of counter.doubleDec(2). In this case, the possible outputs values would be -4, -2, 0, 1, 3 and 5.\nThe value 3 can only be printed in the second case, and only if the counter was first incremented by 5, and then decremented by 2. The counter cannot be first decremented by 2 and then (immediately) incremented by 5, because the methods inc and doubleDec are synchronized.\nA synchronized static method uses the intrinsic lock of the object that represents the class itself (this object is an instance of Class).\nIn other words, the two following classes are equivalent:\npublic class MyClass { static synchronized void myMethod(){ \u0026lt;method body\u0026gt; } } public class MyClass { static void myMethod(){ synchronized(Class.forName(\u0026#34;my.project.name.MyClass\u0026#34;)){ \u0026lt;method body\u0026gt; } } } Condition variables # We saw earlier that a thread $t_1$ can wait for another thread $t_2$ to terminate (e.g. with the pseudocode keyword sync in our abstract model, or in Java with the instance method Thread.join).\nIn this case, when it terminates, $t_2$ wakes up $t_1$, which can resume its execution.\nA similar but more flexible mechanism is the notion of condition variable. Intuitively, it allows putting a thread to sleep, and waking it up when a certain condition is verified.\nA variety of programming languages support condition variables. These include C++, C#, Go, Java, Python or Rust.\nThe producer/consumer pattern # A prototypical application of condition variables is the so-called producer/consumer pattern. In this scenario, two pools of threads (usually with fixed sizes) communicate via a queue.\nA pool of producer threads, which create elements and add (a.k.a. enqueue) them to the queue, A pool of consumer threads, which receive (a.k.a. dequeue) these elements and process them. Two situations may occur where threads should be put to sleep:\nthe queue is empty (e.g. because the process just started, or because elements have been consumed faster than they were produced): consumers should be put to sleep until a new element is produced. the queue is full (e.g. because elements have been produced faster than they were consumed): producers should be put to sleep until an element is consumed. in Java # Reminder. As discussed above, a thread can acquire the intrinsic lock of an object by:\nentering a synchronized block that has this object as lock, or executing a synchronized method for this object. A condition variable in Java can be simulated with a combination of the instance methods Object.wait() and Object.notify() (or Object.notifyAll()).\nwait # The instance method $o$.wait() can only be called by a thread that acquired the intrinsic lock of the object $o$. It has the effect of releasing this lock, and putting the current thread to sleep, until another thread executes $o$.notify() (or $o$.notifyAll()) (for the same object $o$).\nnotify # Similarly to $o$.wait(), the instance method $o$.notify() can only be called by a thread that acquired the intrinsic lock of the object. It has the effect of attempting to wake up one thread (if any) that is waiting for the lock of this object. The awakened thread will only proceed (i.e. actually wake up) after the notifying thread releases the lock of the object.\nnotifyAll # The instance method $o$.notifyAll() is identical to $o$.notify(), but attempts to wake up all threads that are waiting for the lock of this object.\nExample. The following example is an implementation of the producer-consumer pattern borrowed from the Oracle tutorials.\nFor simplicity:\nwe will use a queue with a capacity of 1 (so that the queue is either empty of full), we assume a single producer and a single consumer. pulic class MyQueue\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { T item; boolean isEmpty = true; synchronized void enqueue(T item){ while(!isEmpty){ try { wait(); } catch (InterruptedException e) {} } this.item = item; isEmpty = false; notify(); } } When the producer thread $p$ executes the method enqueue, it acquires the intrinsic lock of the queue (because the method is synchronized). If the queue is full, it releases the lock and waits for the consumer thread to wake it up. If this happens, thread $p$:\nadds the produced item to the queue, indicates that the queue should now be considered nonempty (a.k.a. full, since the queue has capacity 1), wakes up the consumer thread (which was waiting for the queue to be nonempty), releases the intrinsic lock on the queue (by exiting the synchronized method). The method dequeue is symmetric:\npublic class MyQueue\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { ... synchronized T dequeue(){ while(isEmpty){ try { wait(); } catch (InterruptedException e) {} } isEmpty = true; notify(); return item; } } A producer thread could be implemented as follows:\npublic class Producer implements Runnable { private MyQueue\u0026lt;Item\u0026gt; queue; public Producer(MyQueue\u0026lt;Item\u0026gt; queue){ this.queue = queue; } @Override public void run() { while(true){ queue.enqueue(produceItem()); } } Item produceItem(){ ... } } And a consumer thread could be implemented as follows:\npublic class Consumer implements Runnable { private MyQueue\u0026lt;Item\u0026gt; queue; public Consumer(MyQueue\u0026lt;Item\u0026gt; queue){ this.queue = queue; } @Override public void run() { while(true){ consumeItem(queue.dequeue()); } } void consumeItem(Item item){ ... } } Finally, the main thread may spawn one producer and one consumer, as follows:\nMyQueue\u0026lt;Item\u0026gt; queue = new MyQueue\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); Thread p = new Thread(new Producer(queue)); Thread c = new Thread(new Consumer(queue)); p.start(); c.start(); Spurious wakeup # In the example above, the loop while(!isEmpty) (in the method enqueue) seems unnecessary, in the sense that it could be replaced with the conditional statements if(!isEmpty). And similarly for the loop in the method dequeue.\nThe purpose of this loop is to handle the abnormal case where a consumer (resp. producer) is awaken while the condition variable isEmpty has value false (resp. true). Such a situation is called a spurious wakeup, and may have a variety of causes. For instance, in the example above, if we had two producer threads, then one producer thread could wake up the other (instead of waking up the consumer thread), when it exits the method enqueue.\nTo avoid spurious wakeups, it is customary to write:\nwhile(\u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;){ wait(); } rather than:\nif(\u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;){ wait(); } "},{"id":72,"href":"/docs/stream/sections/terminal/","title":"Terminal operation","section":"Streams in Java","content":" Terminal operation # A stream pipeline contains one terminal operation.\nThis operation may for instance:\nexecute a method for each element of the stream (e.g. print the value of each of them), or collect these elements (e.g. into a list), or inspect these elements (check whether all of them satisfy a certain condition), or aggregate these elements (e.g. sum the values of a stream of integers). Stream.forEach # This instance method is similar to Stream.map, in the sense that it also applies a callback method to each element of the stream. However, in this case, the callback method is not a function (i.e. it has no return value).\nIn other words, if the stream has type Stream\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt;, then foreach takes as argument a callback method of type\n$\\qquad \\mathit{T} \\to$ void\n(equivalently, in Java\u0026rsquo;s terminology, the callback method must implement the native functional interface Consumer\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt;, seen earlier).\nExample.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;list = List.of(4, 1, 3, 2, 4); // outputs `4, `2` and `4` list.stream() .filter(x -\u0026gt; x % 2 == 0) .forEach(System.out::println); Hint.

Programs with multiple break statements can be difficult to read and/or debug. A stream with a short-circuiting operation (like anyMatch) can be a way to avoid them.\nExercise What does the method mysteriousMethod below return?\nList\u0026lt;Path\u0026gt; mysteriousMethod(Path path) throws IOException { if (!Files.isDirectory(path)) { return List.of(); } return Files.list(path) .filter(p -\u0026gt; path.toString().endsWith(\u0026#34;.txt\u0026#34;)) .filter(p -\u0026gt; readLines(p).anyMatch(l -\u0026gt; l.contains(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;))) .toList(); } Stream\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; readLines(Path path){ try { return Files.lines(path); } catch (IOException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } Solution The list of all .txt files in the input directory that contain the string foo.\nStream.allMatch # This instance method is analogous to Stream.anyMatch, but checks whether all elements in the stream satisfy the Boolean condition.\nThis is also a short-circuiting operation (if an element does not satisfy the criterion).\nAggregation # Stream.findFirst # This instance method returns the first element in the stream.\nThis is a short-circuiting operation.\nIn combination with Stream.filter, it can simulate Stream.anyMatch.\nThe output value has type Optional\u0026lt;$T$\u0026gt; if the elements of the stream have type $T$ (we will see the meaning of Optional in the dedicated section).\nExample The following two programs are equivalent:\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; integers = getIntegers(); Optional\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; firstEvenNumber = integers.stream() .filter(x -\u0026gt; x % 2 == 0) .findFirst(); $\\qquad$\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; integers = getIntegers(); Optional\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; firstEvenNumber = Optional.empty(); for(int x : integers){ if(x % 2 == 0){ firstEvenNumber = Optional.of(x); break; } } Stream.count # This instance method returns the size of the stream.\nExample.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;list = List.of(2, 1, 3, 1, 2); // has value 2 int size = list.stream() .filter(x -\u0026gt; x % 2 == 0) .count(); Stream.max # This instance method takes as argument a Comparator, and returns (one of) the) maximal element(s) in the stream w.r.t. this comparator (if any).\nThe output value has type Optional\u0026lt;$T$\u0026gt; if the elements of the stream have type $T$ (we will see the meaning of Optional in the dedicated section).\nExample.\nCity ancona = new City(\u0026#34;Ancona\u0026#34;, 60100);, City bologna = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100);, City matera = new City(\u0026#34;Matera\u0026#34;, 75100);, List\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; cities = List.of(ancona, bologna, matera); // Contains matera Optional\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; selectedCity = cities.stream() .max((c1, c2) -\u0026gt; c1.zipCode - c2.zipCode); Stream.reduce # This instance method aggregates the elements of the stream based on a binary operator $\\circ$.\nFor instance, $\\circ$ could be + or * for a stream of numbers, or concatenation for a stream of strings.\nAs an illustration, if the stream has elements\n$\\qquad (a, b, c, d)$\nthen the method reduce returns\n$\\qquad (((a \\circ b) \\circ c) \\circ d)$\nLet us assume that the stream has type Stream\u0026lt;$\\mathit{T}$\u0026gt;.

Consider the Java functional interface Function\u0026lt;T,R\u0026gt; (where T and R are type variables), which stands for all functions with type\n$\\qquad$ T $\\to$ R\nAs we saw in the dedicated section, if X1 $\\sqsubseteq$ X2 and Y1 $\\sqsubseteq$ Y2, then\n$\\qquad$ X2 $\\to$ Y1\nshould intuitively be considered a subtype of\n$\\qquad$ X1 $\\to$ Y2\nTherefore in this case, we would like to treat Function\u0026lt;T,R\u0026gt; as:\ncontravariant in T, and covariant in R. Implementation # As we just saw with the previous examples, some generic types are naturally covariant and/or contravariant in (some of) their type variables.\nSome languages (like C#) provide a syntax to declare that a generic type should always be treated by the compiler as covariant, contravariant, invariant or a combination of them. However, Java does not offer this possibility.\nin Java # Arrays # Java arrays predate (by almost 10 years) the introduction of generics. Technically, in Java, \u0026ldquo;array\u0026rdquo; is not a generic type. But conceptually, it can be thought of as a \u0026ldquo;generic-like\u0026rdquo; type.\nWarning. Java arrays are covariant.\nExample. The following Java program compiles:\nNumber[] anArray; Integer[] anotherArray = new Integer[]{}; anArray = anotherArray; Generic types # Warning. Java generic types are invariant.\nExample. The following Java program does not compile, because the generic type List\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; is invariant:\nList\u0026lt;Number\u0026gt; aList; List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; anotherList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); aList = anotherList; So (unfortunately?) a Java generic type cannot be declared as covariant or contravariant. However, each time we use a generic type, we can specify that it should be interpreted by the compiler as covariant or contravariant.\nCovariance # We saw earlier that the keyword extends specifies an upper bound on the value of a type variable. We can also use it with a ? to allow covariance.\nExample. The following Java program does compiles:\nList\u0026lt;? extends Number\u0026gt; aList; List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; anotherList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); aList = anotherList; Contravariance # The keyword super is symmetric to the keyword extends. It can be used to specify a lower bound on the value of a type variable, or to allow contravariance (in combination with ?).\nExample. The Java interface Stream\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is a generic type, where T is the type of the elements of the stream.\nThis interface has an instance method Stream.filter that takes as argument a callback function with type Predicate\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;.\nAs we saw above, Predicate\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; should intuitively be interpreted as contravariant. Accordingly, the signature of the method filter is\nStream\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; filter(Predicate\u0026lt;? super T\u0026gt; predicate) It accepts as argument any method with type Predicate\u0026lt;V\u0026gt; such that T $\\sqsubseteq$ V. So the following program compiles:\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; integers = getIntegers(); integers.stream() .filter(MyClass::myPredicate); public class MyClass { static boolean myPredicate(Number number) { ... } } Combinations # Example. The instance method Stream.map takes as argument a callback function with type Function\u0026lt;T,R\u0026gt;, where T is the type of the elements of the stream.\nAs we saw above, the generic type Function\u0026lt;T,R\u0026gt; should intuitively be interpreted as contravariant in T and covariant in R. Accordingly, the signature of the method map is:\n\u0026lt;R\u0026gt; Stream\u0026lt;R\u0026gt; map(Function\u0026lt;? super T,? extends R\u0026gt; mapper) When to use covariance or contravariance in Java? # Let us assume a generic type Gen with a type variable T . As a rule of thumb:\nif we use an instance method of Gen that does not take a T as argument, then we may allow Gen to be covariant in T, if we use a method of Gen that does not return a T, then we may allow Gen to be contravariant in T. Example.\npublic class Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { T boxedValue; public Box(T boxedValue){ this.boxedValue = boxedValue; } T getValue(){ return boxedValue; } void setValue(T newValue){ boxedValue = value; } } $\\qquad$\n// Covariance can be used, because the method Box.getValue() does not take a T as argument. Number unbox(Box\u0026lt;? extends Number\u0026gt; box){ return box.getValue(); } // Contravariance can be used, because the method Box.setValue() does not return a T. void replaceValue(Box\u0026lt;? super Integer\u0026gt; box, int integer){ box.setValue(integer); } "},{"id":74,"href":"/docs/abstractdatatypes/","title":"Abstract data types","section":"Docs","content":" Abstract data types # An abstract data type (ADT) is an interface to access and manipulate a collection of elements.\nFor instance, a queue is an ADT that mimics the behavior of a \u0026ldquo;first come first served\u0026rdquo; queue (e.g. a waiting line at a post office). This interface typically exposes three methods:\none that checks whether the queue is empty, one that takes as input an element and adds it to the end of the queue, one that removes the first element of the queue and returns it. An ADT may have several implementations. For instance, a queue may be implemented as an array or as a linked list (among others). Each implementation may have advantages and drawbacks (in terms of performance, memory footprint, parallelization opportunities, etc.) for different tasks (reading, writing, etc.).\nA data structure (e.g. an array, a linked list, a hash table, etc.) is not an ADT, but a (concrete) way to store a collection of elements (values, objects, etc.) in memory. A data structure can be used to implement one or several ADT(s).\nSome ADTs correspond to basic mathematical objects (set, tuple, function, etc.), and are therefore easy to understand and manipulate. They allow you to easily write code that is correct, but may be inefficient if you do not have a good understanding of underlying (concrete) data structure.\nAnother benefit of ADTs is that they can make your code significantly easier to read (thus requiring less documentation). For instance, if your program manipulates a collection of objects without duplicates and whose order is irrelevant, then you can simply use the Java interface Set, which is self-explanatory.\nin Java # Parameterized types # An ADT in Java is usually a parameterized type, meaning that it has one or several types as parameter(s).\nFor instance, a set of strings in Java has type Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;.\nNote. In Java, a primitive type (like int or bool) cannot be used as a type parameter, but a boxed type (like Integer or Boolean) can. For instance, the type Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; is valid.\nThe interface Collection # In Java, many ADTs and data structures extend or implement the interface Collection (the only exception in this chapter is Map).\nAmong others, the interface Collection specifies the following methods (if E is the type of the elements in the collection):\nint size() boolean add(E e) boolean contains(Object o) boolean isEmpty() boolean remove(E e), etc. Warning. Some of these methods are so-called \u0026ldquo;optional operations\u0026rdquo;, meaning that they may not be available for some implementations of Collection.\nLike an array, a collection can be iterated over, for instance with a \u0026ldquo;foreach\u0026rdquo;-like loop:\nfor (E element: myCollection){ ... } Another way to iterate over a collection consists in using an iterator.\nWarning. Some collections (e.g. some implementations of the subinterface Set) do not offer any guarantee on the order of their elements!\nExternal libraries # Some external libraries provide additional implementations of Java\u0026rsquo;s ADTs.\nFor instance, Java has 19 native implementations of the ADT Map (e.g. HashMap,TreeMap, etc.).

This repository contains more than 260.000 artifacts (more than 6 million when counting versions), with over a trillion downloads in 2023.\nAn artifact on Maven Central is identified by its coordinates.\nFinding a library\u0026rsquo;s coordinates # The coordinates of a library are often provided as part of its documentation. For instance, this is the case of Google\u0026rsquo;s Guava library.\nAlternatively, this website can be used to search for the coordinates of an artifact on Maven Central (as well as 1990 other repositories). For instance, here are the coordinates for the latest version of the Smile library for machine learning.\nLocal repository # By default, Maven caches project dependencies (as jars) in a hidden directory with path \u0026lt;homeFolder\u0026gt;/.m2 (or \u0026lt;homeFolder\u0026gt;\\.m2 on Windows). In Maven\u0026rsquo;s terminology:\nthis directory is called the local repository, an artifact is installed when it is added the local repository. When a project is build, Maven searches for each dependency in the local repository. If the corresponding artifact is not installed, then it is downloaded (e.g. from Maven central) and installed.\nGradle proceeds in a similar way (but the cache is under \u0026lt;homeFolder\u0026gt;/.gradle).\nNote. The local repository can contain different versions of the same artifact.\nNote. By default, when installing an artifact, Maven also installs all its missing dependencies, transitively. Gradle proceeds in a similar way.\nWarning. Maven (like Gradle) does not support cyclic dependencies, i.e. an artifact cannot depend on itself (directly or transitively).\nExercise Does this imply that the dependencies of an artifact form a tree?\nSolution No. A tree is a rooted acyclic graph, but the converse does not hold.\nTo display the dependency graph of a project (unraveled as a tree), run:\nmvn dependency:tree If a project depends (transitively) on two versions of the same artifact, then the \u0026ldquo;closest\u0026rdquo; version (in the dependency graph) is chosen (or the first declared in case of a tie).\nNote. If a project depends on a SNAPSHOT version, then the installed artifact is automatically updated on a regular basis (by default once per day), by both Maven and Gradle.\nDeclaring a dependency # Maven # A dependency can be declared by adding the following to the pom.xml file, inside the \u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; tag:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt; XXX \u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt; XXX \u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt; XXX \u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; In addition, the attribute \u0026lt;scope\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;\\scope\u0026gt; can be added to indicate that the dependency is needed for unit tests only (other scopes can be specified).\nExample.

Note. You can create sub-directories (in these directories) to organize your tests and resources.\nGradle # Junit 5 can be used with Gradle in a similar way, but the directories for unit tests and related resources and (usually) specified manually.\nHint. If you chose the board game as your project, then you can write JUnit 5 tests under core/src/test/java. You will also find (dummy) unit tests in the directory core/src/test/java/dummy.\nWriting unit tests # With Maven, any (public or protected) Java class in src/test/java (or a subdirectory) can contain JUnit tests.\nA Junit 5 test is a (public or protected) instance method :\nwith void return type, annotated with org.junit.jupiter.api.Test. In addition, the method usually contains one or several calls to static methods of JUnit\u0026rsquo;s Assertions class, like assertEquals or assertThrows. The test succeeds iff all these calls return true.\nFor instance, the following class contains a single (successful) test:\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals; public class MyTests { @Test void myTest(){ String myString = \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;; assertEquals(true, myString.contains(\u0026#34;oo\u0026#34;)); } } Warning. The method assertEquals takes the expected value as first argument, and the actual one as second argument. This has an incidence on logs in case of test failure (\u0026ldquo;expected\u0026rdquo; : XXX, \u0026ldquo;actual: \u0026ldquo;YYY\u0026rdquo;);\nHint. A string can be passed to assertEquals as third argument, in order to display an additional message in case of failure.\nHint. Most methods of the class Assertions are syntactic sugar (thus not strictly necessary). For instance\nassertTrue(\u0026lt;myExpression\u0026gt;) is a shortcut for\nassertEquals(true, \u0026lt;myExpression\u0026gt;) Warning. By default, the execution of a test method is interrupted as soon as an assertion fails. So subsequent instructions (for instance other assertions) will not be executed.\nChecking exceptions # The assertion assertThrows allows checking whether the execution of a piece of code method throws an exception of a given type. For instance the following unit test succeeds:\n@Test void testException(){ assertThrows( ArithmeticException.class, () -\u0026gt; { int x = 2 / 0; } ); } Prior and/or subsequent code # The annotation @BeforeAll (resp. @AfterAll) can be used to indicate that a (static) method must be executed (only once) before (resp. after) all unit tests in the class, regardless of test successes or failures. This can be used for costly operations, or for opening (resp. closing) a resource, like an connection or an input (resp. output) stream. For instance\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll; import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import java.sql.Connection; public class SQLTests { Connection myConnection; @BeforeAll static void openConnection(){ ... } @Test void test1(){ ... } @Test void test2(){ ... } @AfterAll static void closeConnection(){ ... } } Similarly the annotation @BeforeEach (resp. @AfterEach) can be used to indicate that a method must be executed before (resp. after) each unit test in the class. This can be convenient to avoid copy-pasting code. For instance\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; public class BoardgameTests { Snapshot testSnapshot; @BeforeEach void createTestSnapshot(){ testSnapshot = new DummySnapshot(); } @Test void test1(){ ... } @Test void test2(){ ... } } Disabling tests # A unit test can be disabled with the annotation @Disabled. As a result, it will be ignored by Maven, Gradle, and (to some extent) your IDE. For instance:\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; public class MyTests { @Test @Disabled void test1(){ ... } @Test void test2(){ ... } } Running unit tests # from the command line # For a Maven project, the command\nmvn test executes all phases that precede the test phase (e.g. compile and test-compile) in Maven\u0026rsquo;s default lifecycle, and then executes all unit tests under src/test/java.\nNote. The source code of unit tests (and related resources) is by default excluded form the output of the package phase (e.g. from the jar produced by Maven).\nNote. A unit test failure will prevent execution of Maven phases that are posterior to test. For instance\nmvn package does not produce the expected jar if a test fails.\nHowever, if needed, it is possible to execute a posterior Maven phase while skipping the unit tests, with the option -DskipTests. For instance:\nmvn package -DskipTests within an IDE # IDEs provide several ways to run unit tests, either:\nin isolation, or all tests within a class, or all tests within a package (including subpackages). For instance, with IntelliJ:\nclick on the green arrow to run a single unit test, click on the double green arrow to run all unit tests defined in the current class, right click on a folder and select \u0026ldquo;Run Tests\u0026rdquo; to run all tests in this package.

You can run multiple OSs on the same computer by:\npartitioning your disk, or booting from an external drive, or using virtualisation. Depending on what you are developing, one operating system may be more convenient than another.\nWe review below some benefits and drawbacks of developing under Windows, macOS and Linux.\nWindows # Benefits and drawbacks # Here are some benefits of using Windows as your OS for software development:\nit comes pre-installed on most PCs, it is compatible out-of-the-box with most hardware, it provides a fully integrated development suite for the .NET framework (C#, F#, Visual Basic), and to a lesser extent C/C++. And some drawbacks:\nfor general-purpose development, Windows is less friendly to new programmers (compared to Linux or macOS), the usage of an (OS-wise) package manager is (still) not the norm, it sometimes favors backwards compatibility over compliance with modern standards. When to use Windows (and when not) # Windows is the OS of choice for developing software meant to run on Windows only, or cross-platform software written in one of the .NET languages (mostly C#). C# is notably used for game development (e.g. for Unity) and graphical interfaces (although Javascript-based graphical frameworks may have become more popular lately).\nVisual studio (not VSCode!) offers a fully integrated development suite for the .NET languages, and is also commonly used for C/C++.\nFor other programming languages, using Windows may require extra efforts or precautions (compared to Linux or macOS), especially for new developers.\nIn particular:\nsoftware installation/upgrade/removal can be complex and error-prone, writing scripts (e.g. for two programs to interact) can also be more involved, due to multiple shells. Besides, additional care must be taken to write platform-independent code. Here are two frequent sources of errors made by students:\nPath separators (see the dedicated section),\nLine breaks (see the dedicated section).\nFor this course # You should be able to complete all assignments and write your project using Windows (even if your collaborators use other OSs).\nHowever, you may need to pay extra attention, for instance to path names (as explained above). Installing and configuring the necessary software may also be more complex (again, we recommend using a package manager when possible).\nIf you do not manage to set up your working environment for this course (see the requirements) in a short amount of time, then consider using a Linux distribution instead (see the dedicated section below for using Linux alongside Windows).\nmacOS # Here are some benefits of using macOS as your OS for software development:\nit comes pre-installed with an Apple computer, it is POSIX-compliant (since 2001), thus offering easier interoperability with Linux/BSD/Android/IOS the Homebrew package manager is relatively mature. And some drawbacks:\nsome software may not be available, your working environment is not easily customizable. When to use macOS (and when not) # MacOS is rarely used on hardware other than Apple computers.\nIt is often a good choice for new developers. In particular, Homebrew offers an easy way to install/update/remove programs needed for general-purpose development (compilers, interpreters, other package managers, etc.).\nA number of more experienced developers also work with macOS, notably for web development (Node.js/Javascript) or data science (Python).\nA Linux distribution may be more convenient in some situations, e.g. when developing a program meant to run on a server, or when working with Docker containers.\nFor this course # If you have a Apple laptop, then you should not need an OS other than macOS for this course (even if your collaborators use Windows or Linux).\nLinux # Here are some benefits of using Linux as your OS for software development:\nit is primarily designed for developers, it is relatively lightweight, it has an important (and high-quality) online community support, it is used by most web servers, (OS) package managers are mature and easy to use, your working environment can be easily customized and/or configured. And some drawbacks:\nLinux rarely comes pre-installed on a computer, there is sometimes too much choice (distributions, programs, configuration options, etc.), Linux distributions are (arguably) not as friendly to desktop users as Windows or macOS, Hardware support (e.g. for peripherals) is (still) more limited than for Windows. When to use Linux (and when not) # Linux is often the OS of choice for developing programs meant to run on web servers. It is also a good choice for writing cross-platform software.\nLinux (together with macOS) is also a good environment to learn the basics of programming, due to native compatibility with a wide range of technologies for general-purpose development (e.g. Docker). Software installation, configuration, upgrade and removal is also made easier by mature package managers. Besides, the Linux shell is a versatile yet relatively simple tool that can ease process management or interaction between programs.\nLinux is arguably not the best choice for developing Desktop applications that target a specific OS (such as Windows or macOS), or in some specific domains such as game development.\nFor this course # You should be able to complete all assignments and write your project using a Linux distribution (even if your collaborators use other OSs).\nIn particular, if you face important issues when setting up your working environment (git, JDK, Maven, Gradle, etc. ) on Windows, we recommend using a Linux distribution instead (this may save you time). Keep in mind however that this will not solve issues related to the configuration of your IDE.\nNot that you can use Linux (for development) and Windows (for other purposes) on the same computer.\nWhich distribution to choose # You can use any (reasonably mainstream) all-purposes Linux distribution for this course (and other courses).\nThe choice may seem overwhelming at first sight, but most distributions are forks of a few popular ones (Debian, Fedora, Arch, \u0026hellip;), and are relatively similar to each other. Besides, Linux environments are highly customizable: for instance, the choice of a distribution does not bind you to its default desktop environment. Available software is also very similar from one distribution to another: regardless of the distribution, you will have access to openJDK, git, Maven, etc. via a package manager.\nDesktop oriented distributions # Distributions that are more desktop-oriented can be more friendly to newcomers (especially non-developers), but also come with unnecessary software. Two popular distributions in this category (for new users) are Linux Mint and Zorin OS. Both are forks of Ubuntu, which is itself a fork of Debian.\nLightweight distributions # For a (slightly) more lightweight distribution, MX Linux is currently a popular choice. It is also based on Debian.\nHow to install a Linux distribution # Most distributions provide detailed instructions on their web page.\nRegardless of the distribution, you have are (at least) three possible options:\nVirtual machine (such as VirtualBox). This is the simplest option in terms of installation. But also the most expensive computationally, so only suited to a relatively powerful computer. Performance is also suboptimal.\nA virtual machine is often good way to test a distribution before properly installing it.\nBootable drive. You can store your Linux distribution on an external hard drive, and boot on Linux when the hard drive is connected to your computer. Compared to the third option below, this may affect the performance of disk access.\nPartition (with dual boot). You can dedicate a certain amount of space to a Linux distribution your hard drive. A minimum of 30 GB is often recommended (this can be adjusted later on). When starting your computer, it will let you choose which OS to boot on. This is the best option in terms of performance.\nNote. For the third option (dual boot), the installation procedure has become slightly more involved on some recent computers, due to encrypted disks or so-called \u0026ldquo;secure boot\u0026rdquo;. So make sure that the instructions that you follow are up-to-date.\n"},{"id":84,"href":"/docs/generics/sections/erasure/","title":"Type erasure","section":"Generic programming","content":" Type erasure in Java # Java compilers rely on an approach called type erasure to compile:\ntype parameters (e.g. Box\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;), type variables (e.g. Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;), and question marks (e.g. Box\u0026lt;? extends Number\u0026gt;). More often than not, when a Java program does not compile, we can understand why without understanding the compilation procedure. However, for generics, some basic understanding of type erasure can help.\nProcedure # Intuitively, type erasure consists in producing a program equivalent to the initial one, but free of generic or parameterized types (i.e. intuitively with no \u0026ldquo;diamond\u0026rdquo;).\nInformally, a Java compiler first performs all type checks specified in the program. If all type checks succeed, then:\neach type variable or question mark is replaced with its (upper or lower) bound (if any), or Object if there is none, explicit casts are introduced where they become necessary (as well as so-called bridge methods if needed, to ensure that overriden methods remain overriden), all type parameters, type variables and question marks are deleted. Illustrations # Warning. Type erasure is traditionally illustrated with a Java program before and after erasure (for instance here, but also in Oracle\u0026rsquo;s Java tutorials). However, these illustrations should not be taken literally, because compilation produces byte code, not source code.\nExample. Consider the generic class Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; that we used earlier to illustrate covariance and contravariance, together with the methods unbox and replaceValue:\npublic class Box\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { T boxedValue; public Box(T boxedValue){ this.boxedValue = boxedValue; } T getValue(){ return boxedValue; } void setValue(T newValue){ boxedValue = value; } } $\\qquad$\nNumber unbox(Box\u0026lt;? extends Number\u0026gt; box){ return box.getValue(); } void replaceValue(Box\u0026lt;? super Integer\u0026gt; box, Integer integer){ box.setValue(integer); } The bytecode generated after type erasure may be equivalent to bytecode generated for the following program:\npublic class Box { Object boxedValue; public Box(Object boxedValue){ this.boxedValue = boxedValue; } Object getValue(){ return boxedValue; } void setValue(Object newValue){ boxedValue = value; } } $\\qquad$\nNumber unbox(Box box){ return (Number) box.getValue(); } void replaceValue(Box box, Integer integer){ box.setValue(integer); } Example. Generic methods are compiled in a similar way.\nFor instance, consider once again our generic method\n\u0026lt;T extends Unit\u0026gt; T healthiest(T[] units) { ... } The bytecode generated after type erasure may be equivalent to bytecode generated for a method:\nUnit healthiest(Unit[] units) { ... } Consequences # Runtime # A first important consequence of type erasure (e.g. for debugging) is that parameterized types do not exist at runtime (as opposed C++ or C#).\nFor instance, a JVM cannot distinguish an instance of Box\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; from an instance of Box\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;. Both are instances of the same class Box.\nCompile-time # Type erasure may also explain in some cases why a Java program are invalid.\nWe list here two simple cases (among others).\nAmbiguity # Java (like C++ or C#) allows defining two methods with the same name in the same class, as long as they have different argument types (this is called method overloading). However, after type erasure, this may result in two methods with the same name and arguments (which is forbidden).\nExample. The following program does not compile:\npublic class MyClass\u0026lt;T,V\u0026gt; { void myMethod(String s, T t) { ... } void myMethod(String w, V v) { ... } } Constructor # A type parameter cannot be instantiated.\nExample.

The type (a.k.a. signature) of a method consists of:\nthe type(s) of its argument(s), and its return type. Notation. The type of a method is sometimes described analogously to the domain and codomain of a mathematical function. For instance, consider the following Java method square:\nint square(int x){ return x * x; } This method takes as input an int, and returns an int.\nThis can be written:\n$\\qquad$square$\\colon$ int $\\to$ int\nAnd the type of this method is\n$\\qquad$ int $\\to$ int\nSimilarly, we may use:\nint $\\times$ int $\\to$ int if the method takes two int and returns another, Unit $\\times$ int $\\to$ Unit if the method takes a Unit and an int (in that order) and returns a Unit, Unit[] $\\to$ void if the method takes an array of Units[] and returns nothing, etc. in Java # Syntactically, Java does not provide a method typing system like the one above. Instead, Java uses (abuses?) interfaces for this purpose.\nFunctional interface # A method type in Java is described with a so-called functional interface.\nSyntax. A Java functional interface is an interface with a single (standard) method.\nNote. In this definition, \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; method stands for a method that does not have the default qualifier (\u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; interface methods are also called \u0026ldquo;abstract\u0026rdquo;).\nExample. The following is a functional interface, which describes the type Unit $\\times$ Integer $\\to$ Unit.\ninterface UnitPerIntegerToUnit { Unit execute(Unit unit, Integer x); } Any method with type Unit $\\times$ Integer $\\to$ Unit automatically implements this functional interface. For instance\nUnitPerIntegerToUnit boost = (Unit unit, Integer extraHealth) -\u0026gt; { unit.health += extraHealth; return unit; }; An instance of a functional interface (which is a method) can be executed by calling the (only) method declared in the interface:\nExample (continued).\nUnit boostedUnit = boost.execute(new Unicorn(), 5); The name of a functional interface is irrelevant, as well as the name of its method (and the arguments of this method).\nExample. The following functional interface also describes the type Unit $\\times$ Integer $\\to$ Unit.\ninterface Just { Unit because(Unit we, Integer can); } A functional interface can be annotated with @FunctionalInterface. This will for instance cause a compilation error if the interface has more than one (non-default) method.\nExample.\n@FunctionalInterface interface UnitPerIntegerToUnit { Unit execute(Unit unit, Integer x); } Native functional interfaces # Java provides native (parameterized) functional interfaces for some frequent method types.\nWe highlight here a few of them:\nFunction # The functional interface Function\u0026lt;InputType, OutputType\u0026gt; stands for the type InputType $\\to$ OutputType.

Executing any of these phases triggers the execution of all phases that precede it.\nFor instance, executing the test phase triggers the execution of validate, compile and test-compile (among others).\nGoals and plugins # A build phase (like package) consists of so-called goals.\nA goal can be declared, configured and associated to a specific phase via a so-called plugin.\nIn a POM:\na plugin is specified within the \u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; tag, and plugins are declared within: \u0026lt;build\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugins\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/plugins\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/build\u0026gt; For instance, here is the plugin called maven-jar-plugin, as it is inherited from the Super POM:\n\u0026lt;build\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugins\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.apache.maven.plugins\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;maven-jar-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.4\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;executions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;default-jar\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;phase\u0026gt;package\u0026lt;/phase\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goal\u0026gt;jar\u0026lt;/goal\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/executions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/plugins\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/build\u0026gt; This plugin assigns the goal jar to the phase package.

Method reference as a callback method # Syntax. A Java method reference is written:\nClassName::methodName for a static method, objectVariable::methodName for an instance method, ClassName::new for a constructor. Example (continued).\nLet us assume that our methods boost and penalizeGreen above are static methods of some class called UnitTransformer:\npublic class UnitTransformer{ static void boost(Unit unit){ unit.health++; } static void penalizeGreen(Unit unit){ if(unit.color.equals(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;)){ unit.health--; } } } We can call our method transform with boost as callback method:\nList\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units = getUnits(); transform( units, UnitTransformer::boost ); And similarly with penalizeGreen:\nList\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units = getUnits(); transform( units, UnitTransformer::penalizeGreen ); Lambda expression as a callback method # Alternatively, instead of declaring a method boost, we can directly use a lambda expression:\nExample (continued).\nList\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units = getUnits(); transform( units, unit -\u0026gt; unit.health++ ); And similarly, instead of declaring a method penalizeGreen, we can use the following lambda expression:\nList\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; units = getUnits(); transform( units, unit -\u0026gt; { if(unit.color.equals(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;)){ unit.health-- ; } } ); Native support # Programming languages that support anonymous methods (like Java, Python, C#, C++, JavaScript, etc.) often provide concise syntaxes to use them as callback methods.\nExample(continued).\nIn Java, the above method transform is not necessary. Instead, we can use the native method forEach, available (among others) for any Java Collection.

Consider the following classes:\nNow consider the following program, where the method getUnits produces an array of units that depends on the player\u0026rsquo;s input. The type of objects in this array (Unicorn or Butterfly) cannot be determined at compile time. Thanks to the implicit upcast, they can nonetheless be referred to as (underspecified) units.\nUnit[] units = getUnits(); for (Unit unit: units){ ... } Downcast # Downcasting in Java is frequent for objects whose type cannot be determined at compile time. However, this may not be safe. For instance, in the above example, downcasting a unit from Unit to Unicorn may cause a ClassCastException (at runtime), because this unit is a instance of Butterfly. This is why downcasting is often used in combination with the instanceof operator. For instance the above example can be modifed as follows:\nUnit[] units = getUnits(); for (Unit unit: units){ if(unit instanceof Unicorn){ ((Unicorn) unit).regen(); } } Here the operation (Unicorn) unit is a downcast. This allows the call to the method regen.\nObject equality # As we saw in a previous chapter, a constructor in Java creates an object in memory and returns a (fresh) reference to that object. Since two objects have different locations in memory, their respective references must differ, even if the content of the two objects is identical.\nExample. Consider (a simplified version of) the class City that we saw earlier.\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; public City(String name, int zipCode){ this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipcode; } } The following program will output false:\nCity city1 = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); City city2 = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); System.out.println(city1 == city2); However, in some scenarios, it may be useful to compare the content of two objects, rather than their references. Java provides a native method called equals for this purpose.\nLike the method toString that we saw earlier, the equals is an instance method of the native Java class Object, which is an (implicit) superclass of every other class. So every (user-defined of native) class inherits equals.\nHere is the source code of Object.equals:\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) { return (this == obj); } In other words, by default, this method behaves like the == operator. In order to use this method to check whether two objects are equal, it has to be overriden.\nFor instance, here is a prototypical implementation of the method equals within our class City:\n@Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (this == o) { // same reference return true; } if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; // o is null or has a different type } City downcastObject = (City) o; return zipCode == downcastObject.zipCode \u0026amp;\u0026amp; name.equals(downcastObject.name); } Hint. Your IDE can generate such a method.\nNote in this example:\nthe (safe) downcast from Object to City, and the recursive call to equals (because the attribute name has type String). Recursion # Warning. Similarly to what we saw with the method toString, beware of naive (recursive) implementations of equals if your program can create an object that refers to itself (directly or indirectly).\nBuilt-in implementations # Several native Java classes have their own implementation of equals. We will encounter several of them during this course, notably for the class String and for the implementations of the interface Set.\nThe method hashCode # The method equals is usually overridden together with another method of the class Object, called hashCode. In particular, this is needed for the method equals of the class HashSet to behave correctly. We will explore this topic later in this course, when we introduce the notion of a hash table.\n"},{"id":90,"href":"/docs/background/sections/cost/","title":"Computational cost","section":"Background","content":" Computational cost # In this section, we briefly introduce the standard way to estimate the cost of an algorithm, as a function $f(n)$ of the size $n$ of its input.\nSize # The size $n$ of the input may be the size of its representation in bits.\nOther common measures include:\nthe number of entries for array, the number of nodes for tree, etc. Time or memory # Among others, the function $f(n)$ may estimate:\nthe running time of the algorithm, or its memory consumption.

In other words, does $f(2 n) = 2 f(n)$?\nIf this is the case, then $f$ is a linear function.\nExamples.

If $f(n) = c \\cdot g(n)$ for some constant $c$, then $f$ is in $\\Theta(g)$.\nExamples.\n$f(n) = 3n$ is in $\\Theta(n)$ $f(n) = 2n^3$ is in $\\Theta(n^3)$ $f(n) = 5 \\log n$ is in $\\Theta(\\log n)$ etc. Simplification rule.\nif $f(n) = \\log_a n$ (for some base $a$), then $f$ is in $\\Theta(\\log n)$ if $f(n) = n \\log_a n$ (for some base $a$), then $f$ is in $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ etc. Examples.\n$f(n) = \\log_2 n$ is in $\\Theta(\\log n)$ $f(n) = \\frac{1}{5} \\log_3 n$ is in $\\Theta(\\log_3 n) = \\Theta(\\log n)$ $f(n) = 4n \\log_2 n$ is in $\\Theta(n \\log_2 n) = \\Theta(n \\log n)$ Simplification rule. If $f(n)$ is a sum of terms (e.g. a polynomial), then it belongs to the class that represents the highest order term.\nExamples.\n$f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 20$ is in $\\Theta(2n^2) = \\Theta(n^2)$ $f(n) = \\frac{3}{2}n^3 + 2n^2 + 3n + 20$ is in $\\Theta(\\frac{3}{2}n^3) = \\Theta(n^3)$ $f(n) = 2 n\\log(n) + 3n + \\sqrt{n}$ is in $\\Theta(2 n \\log n) = \\Theta(n \\log n)$ Big $O$ # Notation. $O(f)$ denotes the union of all classes of functions that are at most as expensive as $f$ (asymptotically).\nExample. $f(n) = 3n + 5$ is in $\\Theta(n)$, therefore the following also hold:\n$f$ is in $O(n^2)$ $f$ is in $O(n^2 \\log n)$ $f$ is in $O(n^{2.5})$ $f$ is in $O(n^3)$ $f$ is in $O(2^n)$ Note. As a consequence,\n$\\qquad f$ is in $\\Theta(g)$\nis syntactic sugar for\n$\\qquad f$ is in $O(g)$ and $g$ is in $O(f)$\nOverloaded equality # Warning. Instead of \u0026ldquo;$f$ is in $\\Theta(g)$\u0026rdquo;, it is customary to write:\n$\\qquad f(n) = \\Theta(g)$\n(and similarly for $O$), thus overloading the meaning of the symbol \u0026ldquo;$=$\u0026rdquo;.\nExamples.\n$f(n) = 3n^2 + 5 = \\Theta(n^2)$ $f(n) = 2 n^2 \\log n = \\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$ $f(n) = 2 n^2 = O(n^2)$ $f(n) = 2 n^3 = O(n^3)$ Application # Let us now evaluate the asymptotic cost of some algorithms.\nFor simplicity, we will focus of the worst-case running time (but the same notion of asymptotic cost can be used for average cost and/or memory usage).\nRAM cost model # The so-called Random Access Machine (RAM) model of computation makes several assumptions about computational cost. In particular, for a given index $i$, the cost of accessing the $i^\\text{th}$ element of an array does not depend on the size of this array.\nAnother simplification that is often made (although not consistently by all authors) in the RAM model is that the cost of a value comparison or a basic arithmetic operation (e.g. addition or multiplication) does not depend on the values of its operands.\nExample. Consider the following method\nboolean myMethod(int[] A, int i){ return A[i] + A.length } Let $n$ be the size of the input array $A$, and let us express the running time of this method as a function of $n$. If we adopt the RAM cost model, then:\nthe cost $c_1$ of reading the value A[i] is independent of $n$ the cost $c_2$ of reading the length of A is also independent of $n$ the cost $c_3$ of summing these two values is also independent of $n$ Therefore, expressed as a function $f$ of $n$, the running time of this method is\n$\\qquad f(n) = c_1 + c_2 + c_3$\nwhich is in $\\Theta(1)$.\nIn other words, the running time of this method is constant in the size of the array.\nExample. Consider the same algorithm as above (but where the meaning of foreach is made explicit)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 boolean contains(int[] A, int a){ int i = 0 while (i \u0026lt; A.length) { if(A[i] == a){ return true } i++ } return false } Once again, let $n$ be the size of the input array A, and let us express the worst case running time of this method as a function of $n$.\nRecall that the worst possible input is the one where the input value a does not appear in A. In this case, the loop is executed $n$ times.\nIf we adopt the RAM cost model:\nthe cost $c_1$ of the initialization of i (line 2) is independent of $n$ the cost $c_2$ of one comparison of i with A.length (line 3) is independent of $n$ the cost $c_3$ of one execution of the loop is independent of $n$ the cost $c_4$ of the final return statement (line 8) is independent of $n$ Therefore, expressed as a function $f$ of $n$, the cost of this method is\n$$ f(n) = c_1 + c_2 n + c_3 n + c_4 $$\n$$ \\qquad\\ \\ = (c_2 + c_3) n + c_1 + c_4 $$\nwhich is in $\\Theta(n)$.\nIn other words, the worst-case running time of this method is linear in the size of the array.\nExercise What is the asymptotic running time of the binary search algorithm seen above, expressed as function of the size of the input array A?\nSolution The running time of this algorithm is logarithmic in the size $n$ of the array, i.e. in $\\Theta(\\log n)$.\n"},{"id":91,"href":"/docs/errors/","title":"Errors","section":"Docs","content":" Errors # We all make mistakes when we write code.\nDeveloping efficient strategies to identify mistakes is an essential part of programming.\nCompile time vs runtime errors # In (pre)compiled languages (like Java, C/C++, C#, Python, Rust, Go, etc.), a distinction is generally made between compile time errors and runtime errors.\nA compile time error prevents a program from compiling. It can be thought of as a \u0026ldquo;syntactic\u0026rdquo; error. A runtime error (a.k.a. bug) occurs during the execution of a program. It may depend on the input of the program. Hint. Compile time errors tend to be (much) easier to fix than bugs, especially in large projects. Besides, an IDE can identify some compile time errors (and highlight them) before the program is even compiled.\nSo it is often good practice to write your code in such a way that a maximal number of errors can be identified at compile time.\nNote. For interpreted languages (like Javascript, Lua, etc.), the term \u0026ldquo;compile time error\u0026rdquo; is meaningless. However, a distinction can still be made between errors that can be preemptively identified (e.g. highlighted by an IDE), and errors that can only be detected at runtime.\nError messages # A precise error message can significantly simplify debugging.\nAs a toy example, consider the following Java program:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; public City(String name, int zipCode) { this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipCode; } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public class MyClass{ void myMethod(City[] cities){ City firstCity = cities[0]; if(firstCity.zipCode \u0026gt;= 20000) { System.out.println(firstCity.name.length()); } } } Exercise In this program, there are several reasons why the method MyClass.myMethod may fail at runtime. Can you identify some of them?\nSolution the input array may be null, the input array may have length 0, the input array may be empty, the first city in this array may have a zip code $\\ge$ 20 000 and no name. In the above example, if we execute the following,\nmyMethod(null); then we obtain this error message:\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot load from object array because \u0026#34;cities\u0026#34; is null at MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:5) Note that this message provides a clear indication of:\nthe file (MyClass.java), method in this file (MyClass.myMethod) and line of code (5) that caused the error, the type of error (NullPointerException), the cause of the error (the variable city has value null). Hint. A NullPointerException in Java often indicates an attempt to access an object (or array) via a pointer (e.g. a variable) whose value is null.\nSimilarly, if the method is called with an empty array,\nmyMethod(new City[]{}); we get the following error message:\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0 at MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:5) Exercise Which type of error will the following call to myMethod produce?\nmyMethod(new City[]{ new City(30100, null) }); Solution java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \u0026#34;String.length()\u0026#34; because \u0026#34;firstCity.name\u0026#34; is null at MyClass.myMethod(MyClass.java:7) Anticipation # Consider the following method:\nint least(int x, int y){ return x \u0026lt;= y ? x : y; } This method has two desirable features (shared with mathematical functions):\nany arguments for this method (i.e. any pair of integers in this example) are a valid input, its execution only depends on its arguments, i.e. if the method is called twice with the same arguments, then it has the same behavior. However, this is not the case of all methods.\nIf one of these two condition does not hold, then it may be useful to write your own error messages, in anticipation. This may benefit:\nusers of the program, and collaborators (including your future self!) who will maintain (debug, extend, etc.) the program. Example. For instance, consider a method\nboolean isSolvable (int[][] grid); that takes as input a grid of sudoku, and returns true iff it is solvable, meaning that this grid admits a unique solution. A valid input for this problem could be a 9 x 9 array of integers with values between 0 and 9 (where 0 indicate the absence of value). However, Java does not provide such a precise data type.\nIt may be useful to produce an (informative) error message if the input array:\nis not 9 x 9, or contains a value \u0026lt; 0 or \u0026gt; 9. Controlled environment # Anticipating all types of invalid inputs/scenarios (and producing error messages for these) may induce a lot of boilerplate code. If you have control over the input and/or execution environment of a method, then this may not be necessary. For instance, in the case of auxiliary methods (i.e. methods that are not visible to other classes or components).\nExample (continued). Consider the method boolean isSolvable (int[][] grid) described above. Let us assume that it is private, and called only by a method generateGrid that generates a grid pseudo-randomly.\nIt may be safe to assume that the implementation of generateGrid only produces 9 x 9 arrays with values between 0 and 9. In this scenario, there is probably no need to implement error messages in isSolvable.\n"},{"id":92,"href":"/docs/stream/sections/order/","title":"Multithreading and order","section":"Streams in Java","content":" Multithreading and order # Multithreading # We can allow a whole stream pipeline to be executed in a concurrent or parallel fashion, for instance with the instance method Stream.parallel, as follows:\nExample.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;list = List.of(1, 2, 3); // Contains [3,4,5] List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; ouputList = list.stream() .parallel() .map(i -\u0026gt; i + 2) .toList(); This allows the JVM to take advantage of available resources to execute operations (like the map operation in this example) in several threads, concurrently.\nOrder # From the Javadoc of the package java.util.stream, if the source of a stream is ordered (e.g. a List), then the effect of an operation on the stream is usually predictable.\nIndeed, most operations are constrained to operate on the elements in their \u0026ldquo;encounter order\u0026rdquo;. For instance, if the source of a stream is a List containing [1, 2, 3], then the result of executing map(x -\u0026gt; x * 2) must be [2, 4, 6].\nHowever, in some cases, the terminal operation forEach may ignore the encounter order. If the stream is executed sequentially (which is the case by default), then this usually has no effect on execution. But if the stream is executed in parallel, then this is likely to affect the output.\nIn such a case, the terminal operation forEachOrdered may be used instead of forEach, in order to force this operation to respect the encounter order.\nExample.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;list = List.of(1, 2, 3); // Must output `2` `4` and `6, in this order. list.stream() .parallel() .map(x -\u0026gt; x * 2) .forEachOrdered(System.out::println); Besides, it is possible to relax the ordering constraint with the instance method Stream.unordered(). This may improve performance for pipelines with costly operations, in scenarios where the order of processing is irrelevant.\nExample. In this example, the order in which the elements of the stream are processed is irrelevant because:\nthe map applies a pure function, and the stream is collected as a set.

The serialization format is not (meant to be) human-readable.\nThe process is JVM independent, meaning that an object can be serialized on one platform and deserialized on another.\nTransient # In Java, an instance attribute can be marked with the keyword transient. For instance:\npublic class MyClass { String serializedAttribute; transient int transientAttribute; ... } Transient attributes are excluded from the serialization process (meaning that a serialized object contains no value for its transient attribute).\nWarning.

Instances of the following class are not serializable, because Country does not implement Serializable.\npublic class Country { String name; public Country(String name) { this.name = name; } } Instances of the following class are not serializable either, because the attribute country has type Country, which does not implement Serializable.\npublic class City implements Serializable { String name; int zipCode; Country country; public City(String name, int zipCode, Country country) { this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipCode; this.country = country; } } However, if we replace\nCountry country; with\ntransient Country country; then instances of the class City become serializable, because:\nthe attribute name has type String, which implements Serializable, and the attribute zipCode has a primitive type, and the attribute country is now declared as transient.

The return type of readObject is Object, so the returned object needs to be cast to its appropriate data type.\nExample.

These are often called static attributes (or sometimes class attributes or class variables), as opposed to the attributes that we have seen so far, called instance attributes (or member variables).\nStatic attributes are marked with the keyword static.\nExample. Consider a version of our game where characteristics for each unit type (e.g. default health, etc.) can be declared manually, in a text file. The path to this file could be stored as a static attribute, as follows:\npublic class Unicorn { static String configFile = \u0026#34;units/unicorn.txt\u0026#34;; int health; public Unicorn(){ health = getHealthFromConfigFile(configFile); } public regen(){ health++; } } Each instance of Unicorn carries its own value for the attribute health. But the value of configFile is unique.\nFor instance, the following program creates in memory a unique string for configFile, which is carried by the class.\nUnicorn u1 = new Unicorn(); Unicorn u2 = new Unicorn(); Static methods # Similarly to a static attribute, a static method does not depend on a specific object, as opposed to an instance method.\nExample (continued).\nWe can add to our class Unicorn a static method that checks whether the configuration file exists:\npublic class Unicorn{ ... static boolean configFileExists() { return Files.exists(Paths.get(configFile)); } } (note that the method getHealthFromConfigFile also may also be static, if its execution is identical for all instances of Unicorn).\nRemember that an instance method can be called outside of the class where it is declared, using an instance of the class followed by .:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(); myUnicorn.regen(); A static method can (syntactically) be called in the same way, for instance:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(); boolean valid = myUnicorn.configFileExists(); However, this is often discouraged, because this syntax can be misleading (in this example, configFileExists can be mistaken for an instance method).\nAlternatively, since the method depends on the class (rather than an instance), the call can be prefixed with the class name. This syntax is often preferred, because it leaves no ambiguity. For instance:\nboolean valid = Unicorn.configFileExists(); Note that there may be several instances of a same class in memory during the execution of a program, or no instance at all. This is why a static method cannot access an instance attribute or instance method. For instance, adding the following static method to our class would cause a compilation error, because health is an instance attribute.\npublic class Unicorn { static void reduceHealth(){ health--; } } Inheritance # Two static methods with the same name and signature can be declared in a class and a superclass. In Java\u0026rsquo;s terminology, this is not called method overriding, but instead method hiding. An important difference is that dynamic dispatch (a.k.a. runtime polymorphism) does not apply to this case (the method to be called is determined at compile time, rather than run time).\nExample (continued).\nLet us extend our example with a subclass of Unicorn that hides the static method configFileExists.\npublic class EvilUnicorn extends Unicorn { static boolean configFileExists(){ return false; } } Now consider the following program, where the method getUnicorns produces an array of unicorns that depend on the player\u0026rsquo;s input. The specific type of objects in this array (Unicorn or EvilUnicorn) cannot be determined at compile time.\nUnicorn[] unicorns = getUnicorns(); for (Unicorn unicorn: unicorns){ System.out.println(unicorn.configFileExists()); } } In this example, the method of the superclass (i.e. Unicorn.configFileExists) will be executed for each object in the array, regardless of its type.\nThis is another reason why calling a static method via an instance (rather than via a class name) is often discouraged. In this example, writing Unicorn.configFileExists() (with a capital U) would make it clear that this loop serves no purpose (the same method is executed unicorns.length times).\nJava interfaces # Since Java 8 (2014), an interface can also carry static methods and attributes.\nReflection # Java (as well as C#) offers a mechanism called reflection to intuitively treat classes analogously to objects. Precisely, each class of a program (e.g. the class Unicorn) is associated with an object that represents it. This object is itself an instance of the Java class called Class. It can be accessed either:\nvia an instance of the class: Unicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(); Class unicornClass = myUnicorn.getClass(); or via the qualified name of the class (assuming for instance that the file Unicorn.java is in the folder \u0026lt;workingDirectory\u0026gt;/src/main/java/org/units): Class unicornClass = Class.forName(\u0026#34;org.units.Unicorn\u0026#34;); The instance methods of the class Class are listed here. Among others, they allow:\nlisting the attributes of the class, retrieving its immediate superclass, or the interfaces that it implements, creating a new instance of this class, etc. Reflection is a powerful feature. It is rarely used in everyday code, but can be helpful in specific situations.

This may cause a NullPointerException at runtime, if the method is called by some program that does not check whether this unit is null.\nInstead, we can use\n$\\qquad$ Optional\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; getUnit(int rowIndex, columnIndex)\nto clearly indicate that the return value may not be present.\nSyntax # Declaring an empty Optional # An empty Optional can be initialized with the static method Optional.empty().\nExample.\nOptional\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; unit = Optional.empty(); Setting an Optional\u0026rsquo;s value # The value of an Optional can be set with the static method Optional.of.\nExample.\nOptional\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; unicorn = Optional.of(new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;)); Getting an Optional\u0026rsquo;s value # Whether an Optional has a value can be checked with the instance method Optional.isPresent(), and the value (if present) can be retrieved with the instance method Optional.get().\nExample.\nOptional\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; unit = board.getUnit(rowIndex, columnIndex); if(unit.isPresent()){ unit.get().boost(); } The instance method Optional.ifPresent can be used (as an alternative) for the same purpose.\nIf the optional object has type Optional\u0026lt;$T$\u0026gt;, then ifPresent takes as argument a callback method with type\n$\\qquad T \\to$ void\n(a.k.a. a Java Consumer) that is executed iff the Optional is nonempty.\nExample.\nOptional\u0026lt;Unit\u0026gt; unit = board.getUnit(rowIndex, columnIndex); unit.ifPresent(u -\u0026gt; u.boost()); Primitive types # Java 8 also introduced the container OptionalInt (resp. OptionalLong, OptionalDouble), which behaves analogously to Optional\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; (resp. Optional\u0026lt;Long\u0026gt;, Optional\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt;), but contains an int (resp. long, double). It is mostly used in combination with IntStream (resp. LongStream, DoubleStream).\nOptional and streams # Some methods of the interface Stream\u0026lt;$T$\u0026gt; (resp. IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream) return an Optional\u0026lt;$T$\u0026gt; (resp.OptionalInt, OptionalLong, OptionalDouble).\nIn particular:\nfindFirst average, max and min etc. "},{"id":100,"href":"/docs/recursion/","title":"Recursion","section":"Docs","content":" Recursion # Warmup # Exercise In this exercise, we assume that a folder can only contain files or other folders.\nWrite (in pseudocode) a method void printFiles(String folder) that:\ntakes as input an absolute path to an (existing) folder $f$, and prints an absolute path to each file contained recursively in $f$ (in any order). For instance, in the following example,\n└── foo ├── fred.txt └── bar ├── thud.txt └── waldo.txt printFiles(\u0026quot;/foo\u0026quot;) should print (in any order):\n/foo/fred.txt /foo/bar/thud.txt /foo/bar/waldo.txt printFiles(\u0026quot;foo/bar\u0026quot;) should print (in any order):\n/foo/bar/thud.txt /foo/bar/waldo.txt You can assume that the following methods are available:\nvoid print(String string) prints the input string, boolean isFile(String path) returns true iff path is a path to a file, Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; children(String path) takes a path to a folder, and returns a path to each file or folder that it contains (non-recursively).

Possible solution void printFiles(String folder){ foreach child in children(folder){ if(isFile(child)){ print(child) } else { printFiles(child) } } } Recursive method # Definition. A method is recursive if it calls itself, directly or indirectly.\nFor instance (in pseudocode):\nthe following method is recursive: myMethod() { ... myMethod() ... } the following two methods are recursive: myMethod1() { ... myMethod2() ... } myMethod2() { ... myMethod1() ... } Usage # In theory, a recursive algorithm can be rewritten using loops only (and conversely).\nHowever, in practice, some problems are easier to solve recursively. In particular, this is the case of many problem that involve tree-like structures (e.g. a folder, a JSON or XML document, an algebraic expression, etc.), and more generally graphs.\nThe following methodology can be used to solve a variety of problems:\nMethodology. To solve a problem recursively:\n(Base case). If the input $I$ is minimal (e.g. of size 0 or size 1), then solve the problem directly. (Inductive case). Otherwise: Decompose $I$ into smaller inputs $I_1$, .., $I_k$. Solve the problem (recursively) for $I_1$, .., $I_k$. Combine the results (if needed). In other words, in the inductive case, solve the problem for $I$ under the assumption that it can be solved for $I_1$, .., $I_k$.\nExample: binary trees # Definition. An ordered tree is a tree where the children of each node are totally ordered.\nDefinition. A binary tree is an ordered tree where each node has exactly two (possibly null) children.\nExample. This is a binary tree:\nExercise Let us represent a node in a binary tree as an instance of the following class:\nWrite (in pseudocode) a method int sum(Node root) that takes as input the root of a binary tree, and returns the sum of all values in the tree.\nFor instance, for the following tree, the method should return 13:\nPossible solution int sum(Node root){ // base case if (root == null){ return 0 } // inductive case return root.value + sum(root.leftChild) + sum(root.rightChild) } Exercise Let us represent a binary tree as above, but where nodes have no label:\nWrite (in pseudocode) a method int height(Node root) that takes as input the root of such a tree, and returns the number of nodes in the longest branch of this tree.\nFor instance, for the following tree, the method should return 4:\nPossible solution int height(Node root){ //base case if (root == null){ return 0 } // inductive case return 1 + max( height(root.leftChild), height(root.rightChild) ) } Processing order # Exercise Let us represent a binary tree as above, but where nodes are labeled with a character.\nConsider the following recursive algorithm:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 traverse(Node root){ // inductive case only (do nothing in the base case) if (root != null){ print(root.label) traverse(root.leftChild) traverse(root.rightChild) } } What does this algorithm print for the following input tree?\nSolution A B D H E I J C F K L G M\nExercise What about the following algorithm (for the same tree)?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 traverse(Node root){ // inductive case only (do nothing in the base case) if (root != null){ traverse(root.leftChild) print(root.label) traverse(root.rightChild) } } Solution D H B I E J A K F L C G M\nExercise And this algorithm?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 traverse(Node root){ // inductive case only (do nothing in the base case) if (root != null){ traverse(root.leftChild) traverse(root.rightChild) print(root.label) } } Solution H D I J E B A K L F M G C\nDefinition. In the above exercises, the three node processing orders are respectively called pre-order traversal, in-order traversal and post-order traversal.\nThese three algorithms can be adapted to solve a variety of problems.\nHint. In-order traversal processes nodes in left-to-right order (when projected to a line).\nExercise Let us consider once again a binary tree where nodes are labeled with a character.\nWrite (in pseudocode) a method Node leftMost(Node root, char label) that returns the leftmost node labeled with label in the tree rooted in root (or null if there is no such node).\nPossible solution We can adapt the in-order traversal algorithm (above), as follows:\nNode leftMost(Node root, char label){ // Base case. if(root == null){ return null } // Inductive case. // Explore the left subtree first. Node candidate = leftMost(root.leftChild, label) // If the call succeeded, then we found the leftmost occurrence in the tree. if(candidate != null){ return candidate } // Otherwise the next candidate (from left to right) is the current node. if (root.label == label) { return root } // If both attempts failed, then explore the right subtree. return leftMost(root.rightChild, label) } Syntax # A recursive method often has the following structure (in pseudocode):\nmyMethod(Type input) { // base case if(\u0026lt;input is minimal\u0026gt;) { ... // inductive case } else { ... myMethod(smallerInput_1) ... myMethod(smallerInput_2) ... ... myMethod(smallerInput_k) ... } } Observation. Termination is guaranteed if the input of each recursive call is strictly smaller than the current input.\nAuxiliary recursive method # A recursive method is often an auxiliary method. For instance, some problems with an array as input can be solved recursively by dividing the array in sub-segments, as follows (in pseudocode):\nsolveProblem(Type[] array) { if(array.length != 0){ // the initial segment is the whole array solveProblemRec(array, 0, array.length - 1) } } solveProblemRec(Type[] array, int startIndex, int endIndex) // base case (segment of length 1) if(startIndex == endIndex) { ... // inductive case } else { // middle index (rounded down) int middleIndex = (startIndex + endIndex) / 2 ... // recursive call on the left subsegment solveProblemRec(array, startIndex, middleIndex) ... // recursive call on the right subsegment solveProblemRec(array, middleIndex + 1, endIndex) ... } } Multiple return values # It is frequent for a recursive method to return multiple values. For instance, in a binary tree, return the least label (in alphabetical order) and the maximal depth at which it occurs.\nIn Java 14 or later, this can be easily achieved by returning a record. For instance:\nrecord Result(Character leastLabel, int depth){}; Result leastLabelAndDepth(Node root) { // Base case. if (root == null) { return new Result(null, 0); } // Inductive case. // Recursive calls. Result leftResult = leastLabelAndDepth(root.leftChild); Result rightResult = leastLabelAndDepth(root.rightChild); // Initialize the return values with the values returned by the left recursive call. char leastLabel = leftResult.leastLabel; int depth = leftResult.depth; // If the least label in the right subtree is \u0026lt; to the least label in the left subtree if (rightResult.leastLabel \u0026lt; leastLabel) { leastLabel = rightResult.leastLabel; depth = rightResult.depth; // If the least labels in the right and left subtrees are identical } else if (rightResult.leastLabel == leastLabel) { depth = Math.max(depth, rightResult.depth); } // If the root\u0026#39;s label is \u0026lt; to the least label seen so far if (root.label \u0026lt; leastLabel) { leastLabel = root.label; depth = 0; } return new Result(leastLabel, depth + 1); } "},{"id":101,"href":"/docs/git/sections/sharing/","title":"Synchronization: remote, push, pull","section":"Git","content":" Synchronization: remote, push, pull # List remotes # To list the remote(s) associated to your repository (name and address of each remote), you can run\ngit remote -v Upload # If the current branch is already shared with a remote, you can upload it with\ngit push Otherwise, you can share this branch (and its commits) with\ngit push -u \u0026lt;remoteName\u0026gt; \u0026lt;branchName\u0026gt; To delete a remote branch, run\ngit push \u0026lt;remoteName\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;branchName\u0026gt; Alternatively, you can delete a remote branch using the web interface of your hosting service.\nDownload # If your current branch is shared with your remote, you can update your local copy with\ngit pull Warning.

But depending on your workflow, you may want to try a more advanced one.\nVSCode # VSCode is introduced in the section dedicated to IDEs.\nvi and Emacs # These are two keyboard-centric editors. Both were developed in the 70\u0026rsquo;s (before the mouse became a widespread peripheral) but are still commonly used today (in some form) by developers.\nWe do not recommend learning vi or Emacs at this (early) stage of your studies, because it requires time (and you arguably have more fundamental thing to learn). But you may give them a try at some point of your career, because they can significantly improve your productivity.\nvi/vim/neovim # vi was initially released 1978, as part of the first BSD distribution. The original program is rarely used today, but vim (for \u0026ldquo;vi improved\u0026rdquo;), released in 1991, and neovim, released in 2015 are still popular among developers. For instance, 22% (resp. 12%, non-exclusive) of respondents to the 2023 Stack Overflow developer survey use vim (resp. neovim) as a code editor.\nvi/vim/neovim is a so-called modal editor, meaning that users can switch between different modes. In one mode, pressing a standard key inserts the corresponding character, whereas in another mode, pressing the same key has a different functionality (navigation, copy, paste, etc.). These functionalities are referred to as vi keybindings or vi motions, and allow performing a variety of text editing operations in an efficient way.\nvi keybindings are commonly used in applications other than vi/vim/neovim, with dedicated plugins. For instance, most code editors/IDEs (VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Emacs, etc.), terminal emulators or even web browsers have plugins for vi keybindings.\nNote. vim and neovim are very customizable, with comprehensive collections of (community-developed) plugins, which allows using them as IDEs. We do not recommend trying this at this stage of your studies, because configuration may require a significant time investment (more than VSCode for instance).\nWarning. The original vi still comes pre-installed on many operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, \u0026hellip;), and may be the default text editor opened by terminal-based applications (e.g. git) on your system. If this is the case (and if you do not know the vi keybindings), then we recommend changing this setting.\nEmacs # Emacs was initially written in 1976. The most popular version is GNU Emacs, released in 91, was notably co-developed by Richard Stallman.\nEmacs is partly responsible for popularizing (sequences of) combinations of keys (e.g. Ctrl+\u0026lt;letter\u0026gt;), as opposed to modal editors like vi. GNU Emacs has more than 10 000 built-in commands, and also provides a (limited) mouse interface.\n5% of respondents to the 2023 Stack Overflow developer survey use Emacs as a code editor.\nEmacs is also very customizable, with a comprehensive collections of (community-developed) plugins (probably more comprehensive than vim), and dedicated software repositories. Notably, Emacs tends to serve as a unique user interface for a variety of tasks (code editing, terminal emulation, email management, web browsing, playing music/videos, etc.).\nNote. Emacs can be used as an IDE, but for the same reason as for vim or neovim, we do not recommend trying this at this stage of your studies.\n"},{"id":103,"href":"/docs/multithreading/sections/troubleshooting/","title":"Troubleshooting","section":"Multithreading","content":" Troubleshooting # Alongside race conditions, there are several reasons why a program that uses multithreading may not behave as intended.\nTwo common ones are deadlocks and (to a lesser extent) starvation.\nDeadlock # Terminology.

A method is said to be thread-safe if it can be accessed concurrently by several threads without \u0026ldquo;unexpected\u0026rdquo; consequences.\nThread safety is a vague term, which may for instance refer to implementations that are free of race conditions.\nMost high-level libraries or frameworks that exploit concurrency provide methods with some from of thread safety. In particular, this is the case of most Graphical User Interface frameworks (such as JavaFX or Swing for Java).\nBy default, it is highly recommended to rely on such methods when using concurrency. For instance, Effective Java (Item 81) recommends using thread-safe concurrency utilities when possible, rather than Java\u0026rsquo;s (error prone) wait, notify and notifyAll methods.\nAtomic operation # Terminology. An operation performed by a thread is atomic if no operation performed by another (concurrent or parallel) thread can affect its execution.\nWe saw earlier that the operation\ni++; is not atomic, but corresponds to a sequence of instructions (fetch, increment and write).\nThe package java.util.concurrent.atomic provides classes like AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean or AtomicReference that support atomic operations.\nExample. The program\nAtomicInteger i = new AtomicInteger(0); int j = i.getAndIncrement(); is analogous to\nint i = 0; int j = i++; but the operation i.getAndIncrement() is atomic, whereas i++ is not.\nAssociative array # ConcurrentMap # The interface ConcurrentMap is a sub-interface of Map (which stands for an associative array) with additional atomicity and thread-safety guarantees.\nIt has two native implementations, one as a hash table, the other as a so-called skip list. The latter maintains the order of insertion, analogously to what we saw for a LinkedHashMap.\nConcurrentNavigableMap # The interface ConcurrentNavigableMap is a sub-interface of SortedMap (like TreeMap, that we saw in the dedicated section), with additional atomicity and thread-safety guarantees. It has one native implementations, as a skip list.\nQueue # The Java interface BlockingQueue is a sub-interface of Queue (which stands for the abstract data type queue). In addition to the traditional operations supported by a queue (dequeue and enqueue), a blocking queue provides variants of these operations to:\nwait for the queue to become non-empty (when dequeuing), or wait for space to be freed in the queue (when enqueueing). These allow implementing the producer/consumer pattern seen earlier, without relying on Java\u0026rsquo;s wait, notify and notifyAll methods.\nBlockingQueue has several native implementations (e.g. as a doubly linked list or as a dynamic array).\nThread pool # A thread pool is a set of threads (of fixed or flexible size) that can be reused for different tasks.\nThe factory class Executors provides a series of static methods that return a thread pool. In particular:\nExecutors.newFixedThreadPool returns a pool (instance of ExecutorService) with a fixed number of threads (specified as argument), Executors.newCachedThreadPool returns a pool (also instance of ExecutorService), but with flexible size. In both cases, tasks submitted to the pool will reuse existing threads if available.\nA quick introduction to Java thread pools can be found here.\n"},{"id":105,"href":"/docs/git/sections/backtracking/","title":"Backtracking","section":"Git","content":" Backtracking # We already saw how a file can be unstaged (with git reset) before it is committed.\nIf the file was committed by mistake, then there are at least three scenarios.\nReset # If the commits that contain the file have not been shared yet with a remote, then these commits can be cancelled locally.

For this course, you can use any IDE (or enhanced text editor) for Java with the features above. In this section, we give a brief overview of the most popular options.\nVisual Studio Code (VSCode) # Warning. VSCode and Visual Studio are two independent programs, and serve different purposes. In particular, Visual Studio does not natively support Java anymore (although this may technically be achieved with an LSP server and a DAP debugger, as explained below).\nVSCode is a (mostly) open-source project, primarily developed by Microsoft. Precisely, Code-OSS is a (fully) open source editor, and VSCode is a distribution of Code-OSS with additional features.\nVSCode is a general-purpose code editor, initially designed with a focus on web development (Node.js/Javascript). VSCode has probably become the most popular code editor among developers. For instance, it is used by 74% of respondents of the 2023 StackOverflow developer survey.\nNote. VSCode is often categorized as a \u0026ldquo;code editor\u0026rdquo; rather than an IDE. For this course, VSCode (together with some plugins) can serve as a Java IDE, so we will refer to it as an IDE for simplicity.\nExtensibility # The success of VSCode is often explained by its rich repository of (community-developed) plugins. At least two factors played a role:\nWeb development stack # VSCode is based on Electron, which allows writing plugins in Javascript, taking advantage of a vast ecosystem of code written for web applications (notably for graphical components).\nLSP and DAP # VSCode developers introduced standardized protocols for some IDE functionalities (like the ones listed above): the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP). These protocols specify (programming language independent) interfaces for communication between a code editor and a so-called \u0026ldquo;language server\u0026rdquo; (for LSP) or a debugger (for DAP).\nThis led to the development of LSP servers and DAP debuggers (or more often interfaces for existing debuggers) for a variety of programming languages (a list of LSP servers and features they implement can be found here).\nAn additional benefit is that other editors (notably neovim, Emacs and Visual Studio) have developed support LSP servers and DAP debuggers.\nfor Java # VSCode can be used as a Java IDE (at least to some extent) thanks to some plugins. For this course, you may use the extension pack for Java. If you choose the board game as your project, you may also need a plugin for Gradle, such as this one.\nIn some cases, using VSCode may require a little bit more configuration than a Java-centric IDE.\nEclipse, Netbeans and Intellij IDEA # These three editors have similar functionalities, and any of these three can be used for this course. All three were designed with Java in mind, and thus offer advanced integration with a variety of Java frameworks. Each of them also supports other programming languages, but the list varies from one editor to the other.\nAs of today, Intellij IDEA (IntelliJ for short) is probably the most popular Java-centric editor. This is a closed-source project, thus offering more limited customization than the other two.\nEclipse is an open-source project with a large ecosystem. It is known for its community support and its advanced plugin system, which led to the development of multiple extensions over the years (including support for C/C++, Python, etc.). Note that for performance reasons, Eclipse comes with its own Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which in some (rare) cases may not behave like other JVMs.\nNetbeans is also an open-source project. Notably, Netbeans provides a graphical tool to design Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the Java Swing framework.

Note that the name of the JSON attribute and the name of the constructor argument can differ (e.g. \u0026ldquo;code\u0026rdquo; and zipCode in this example).\nThese annotations can also be used to populate more complex structures, such as nested objects, arrays, collections, etc. For instance:\npublic class Country { String name; @JsonCreator public Country(@JsonProperty(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) String name) { this.name = name; } } String jsonCountries = \u0026#34;[ \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;name\\\u0026#34; : \\\u0026#34;Italy\\\u0026#34;}, \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;name\\\u0026#34; : \\\u0026#34;Austria\\\u0026#34;} \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;]\u0026#34;; /* Contains the objects Country{ name: \u0026#34;Italy\u0026#34; } and Country{ name: \u0026#34;Austria\u0026#34; }, in this order. */ Country[] countries = mapper.readValue(jsonCountries, Country[].class); Exercise What does the following program print?\npublic class City { public String name; public Country country; @JsonCreator public City(@JsonProperty(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) String name, @JsonProperty(\u0026#34;country\u0026#34;) Country country) { this.name = name; this.country = country; } } public class Country { public String name; @JsonCreator public Country(@JsonProperty(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;) String name){ this.name = name; } } Country italy = new Country(\u0026#34;Italy\u0026#34;); City rome = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, italy); City bologna = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, italy); City[] cities = new City[]{rome, bologna}; // count countries System.out.println(countCountries(cities)); // serialize String serializedCities = mapper.writeValueAsString(cities); // deserialize City[] deserializedCities = mapper.readValue(serializedCities, City[].class); // count countries System.out.println(countCountries(deserializedCities)); // Counts the number of distinct countries that appear in the input array private int countCountries(City[] cities) { Set\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; countries = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); for(City city: cities){ countries.add(city.country); } return countries.size(); } Solution 1\n2\nWriting to or reading from a file # The ObjectMapper class provides utility methods to write (resp. read) the JSON output (resp. input) directly to (resp. from) a file.

For instance, if our game only allows \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; as unit colors, then we may create a dedicated type that only allows these three values.\nIn Java # An enumerated type in Java is a set of constants. These constants are effectively static, meaning that they depends on the class (or interface) where the enumerated type is declared (similarly to a static attribute). The name of an enumerated type can generally be used like a regular reference type. For instance\npublic class Unit { enum UnitColor {BLUE, GREEN, RED} int health; UnitColor color; public Unit(int health, UnitColor color){ this.health = health; this.color = color; } ... } Note. In the above example, the enumerated type UnitColor could equivalently be represented with an integer. For instance, 0 for blue, 1 for green and 2 for red. However, with such an encoding, a conditional statement (e.g. if or switch) that checks the color of a unit would also need to handle the case of values \u0026lt; 0 or \u0026gt; 2. So (besides readability), a benefit of the enumerated type in this case is that it restricts possible inputs to valid ones.\nHint. Enumerated types in Java are significantly more expressive than their counterparts in some other languages. Notably, a Java enum can have its own constructor and methods.\nRecords # A record is an object whose attributes cannot be modified.\nin Java # Records were introduced in Java 14 (2020). They are a convenient way to avoid boilerplate code. Records provide a concise syntax for \u0026ldquo;lightweight\u0026rdquo; classes that are only meant to hold data.\nFor instance, here is the full implementation of a record City:\npublic record City(String name, int zipCode) {} This record has an implicit constructor, and implements equals, hashcode and toString in the expected way. For instance:\nCity florence = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); City florenceAgain = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); // Outputs true. System.out.println(florence.equals(florenceAgain)); The attributes of a record cannot be modified. For instance, the following program does not compile:\nCity florence = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); florence.zipCode = 50121; A record is often declared inside a class or interface. For instance, in our game:\npublic class Board { public record TileCoordinates(int X, int Y){}; ... } Records are convenient for methods that need to return more than one value. For instance:\nTileCoordinates getOngoingMove(); Strings # Interning # Many modern languages (such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, etc.) use an optimization technique called interning in order to manage strings (or sometimes integers, etc.) in memory. This consists in storing only one copy of each distinct string created during the execution of a program. These strings are stored in a shared pool, and each of them is an immutable object (meaning that it cannot be modified).\nSome benefits are faster string comparisons, lower memory footprint, etc.\nin Java # In Java, a string is an object. Like for regular objects, comparing two variables of type String with == compares their references:\nString myString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); String sameString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); // Outputs false, because the two variables hold different references. System.out.println(myString == sameString); A string can be explicitly interned (i.e. added to the shared pool) with the (instance) method intern. This method:\ntries to add the string to the pool, and then returns a reference to the (only) version of the string contained in the pool. For instance, consider the following program:\n// Creates a string \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, String myString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;) // adds it to the pool, myString = myString.intern(); // Creates another string \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, String sameString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); // Outputs false. System.out.println(myString == sameString); // Tries to add \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; to the pool once again. // Because the pool already contains a version of \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, returns a reference to it. sameString = sameString.intern(); // Outputs true, because the two variables now hold the same reference. System.out.println(myString == sameString); A string that is initialized without constructor (i.e. directly with \u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;) is interned. For instance\nString myString = \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;; String sameString = \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;; // Outputs true, because of (implicit) interning System.out.println(myString == sameString); In order to support interning, string in Java are immutable.\nIn particular, the instance methods of the class String do not modify the current string, even if the names of some of these methods (substring, replace, etc.) suggest that they do. Instead, these methods (may) return (a reference to) a different object. For instance:\nString foo = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); String copy = foo; // Outputs true, because the two variables hold the same object reference. System.out.println(copy == foo); foo = foo.replace(\u0026#39;o\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;); // Outputs false, because the method \u0026#39;replace\u0026#39; returns a reference // to another object. System.out.println(copy == foo); The class String overrides the method equals so that it implements string comparison in the expected way. For instance:\nString myString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); String sameString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); // Outputs false. System.out.println(myString == sameString); // Outputs true. System.out.println(myString.equals(sameString)); Hint. By default, you can always use equals to compare the values of two strings. This is less error-prone than == (albeit less efficient if the two strings differ).\nJava boxed types # Java has 8 primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.\nFor each primitive type, Java has a so-called boxed or (wrapper) type: Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Boolean and Character.\nThese types can be used in Java collections (Set, List, etc.), whereas primitive types cannot. Some boxed types also offer additional functionalities, via instance methods (e.g. an Integer can represent a positive numbers up to $2^{32} - 1$.\nConstructors for boxed types are deprecated. Instead, instances can be created via so-called autoboxing, for instance:\nInteger myInteger = 2; Character myCharacter = \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;; Several Java operators (like +, ==, \u0026lt;=, etc.) are also overloaded so that they behave with boxed types as they would with primitive types. For instance:\nInteger i = 1; i += 1; Integer j = 2; // Outputs true System.out.println(i == j); Like strings, instances of boxed types are immutable. This can affect performance. For instance:\nfor (Integer i = 0; i \u0026lt; 1000000 ; i++){ ... } may create up to 1 million objects in memory. This is one of the reasons why it is usually recommended to use primitive types whenever possible (see for instance Effective Java, Item 61). Some boxed types are (partially) interned, analogously to strings.\n"},{"id":109,"href":"/docs/lambda/sections/currying/","title":"Currying","section":"First-class methods","content":" Currying # Illustration # Example (continued).\nIn the previous section, we encountered the function $g \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to (\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N})$ defined by:\n$$ g(x) = y \\mapsto x^y$$\nAs we saw in a previous exercise, for any pair $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$: $$ g(x)(y) = x^y $$\nThe function $g$ is called the curried form of the function\n$$(x, y) \\mapsto x^y $$\nNotation # Before defining currying, we introduce a convenient notation:\nSyntax.

For instance, functions in Haskell are traditionally written in curried form.\nCode factorization # Example.\nIn Java, we may have a method with signature\nvoid convert(int radix, int input) that prints the digits of the number input in base radix (for instance, convert(2,5) should print 101).\nWe may want to do this for each element of a list of numbers myList, and for different bases, e.g. once in base 2 and once in base 8.\nWe could declare two new methods:\nvoid convertToBaseTwo(int input){ convert(2, input); } void convertToBaseEight(int input){ convert(8, input); } Then we could pass these two methods to the method forEach encountered earlier:\nmyList.forEach(MyClass::convertToBaseTwo); myList.forEach(MyClass::convertToBaseEight); However, with this pattern, for each new radix X, we would need to create a new method convertToBaseX. Besides, if the desired radix is only supplied at runtime (e.g. by the system\u0026rsquo;s user), then this pattern cannot be applied.\nIntuitively, we would like to produce (on the fly) a method convertToBaseX that converts an integer into base X. This is precisely what the curried form of the method convert does.\nThis method has type Integer $\\to$ Integer $\\to$ void, and can be defined as:\nConsumer\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; curriedConvert(int radix) { return x -\u0026gt; convert(radix, x); } This allows us to generate closures and pass them as arguments to the method forEach:\nmyList.forEach(curriedConvert(2)); myList.forEach(curriedConvert(8)); int radix = getRadixFromUser(); myList.forEach(curriedConvert(radix)); Alternatively, we could use the curried form of convert anonymously:\nmyList.forEach(x -\u0026gt; convert(2, x)); myList.forEach(x -\u0026gt; convert(8, x)); int radix = getRadixFromUser(); myList.forEach(x -\u0026gt; convert(radix, x)); N-ary method # We saw earlier that Java has native types (precisely, functional interfaces) for methods with up to two arguments. For instance Function and BiFunction, Consumer and BiConsumer, Supplier, etc.\nHowever, there is no such type for methods with more than two arguments.

Assume that we want to write a method that takes as input a callback method with type\n$\\qquad$ Integer $\\times$ Integer $\\times$ Integer $\\to$ String\nThere is no native type in Java for the callback method.\nInstead, we can use a callback method in curried form, with type\n$\\qquad$ Integer $\\to$ Integer $\\to$ Integer $\\to$ String\nOr in Java\nFunction\u0026lt;Integer, Function\u0026lt;Integer, Function\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; "},{"id":110,"href":"/docs/objects/sections/clone/","title":"Duplicating objects","section":"Objects and classes","content":" Duplicating objects # In some scenarios, it may be useful to duplicate an object.\nIn Java, as we saw earlier, copying the value of a variable with reference type does not copy the object that it references. For instance, the following program outputs \u0026ldquo;yellow\u0026rdquo;:\nUnicorn unicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Unicorn theSameUnicorn = unicorn; unicorn.color = \u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;; System.out.println(theSameUnicorn.color); The need to duplicate objects may notably appear in a program that relies on concurrency.\nExercise In our game, the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component is in charge of rendering the game visually.\nThis component exposes a method called drawSnapshot that takes as input a game snapshot and draws this snapshot on screen. The backend calls this method whenever a snapshot must be drawn. However, the backend may send these snapshots faster than they can be displayed (due to the duration of on-screen animations).\nTo deal with this scenario, the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; buffers the snapshots that it receives (displaying a new snapshot only after all previously submitted ones have been displayed). For the sake of this exercise, you can think of this buffer as an array with type Snapshot[].\nNow consider the following method deleteUnit(int x, int y), executed by our backend each time it receives the instruction to delete a unit:\npublic class Backend implements EventHandler { Snapshot currentSnapshot; ... public void deleteUnit(int x, int y){ // if there is a unit on the tile if(currentSnapshot.getBoard().getUnit(x,y).isPresent()){ removeUnitFromTile(x, y); drawSnapshot(currentSnapshot); shiftUnitsInColumn(x); drawSnapshot(currentSnapshot); performUnitMerges(); drawSnapshot(currentSnapshot); ... } } } where the auxiliary methods removeUnitFromTile, shiftUnitsInColumn and performUnitMerges may modify the object currentSnapshot.\nObserve that the method deleteUnit calls drawSnapshot three times.\nNow let us assume that the buffer of the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; is nonempty when this method is executed, so that the 3 snapshots are added to the buffer, before any of them can be rendered on screen.\nHow many of these 3 snapshots will be drawn on screen?\nSolution Only the third snapshot will be drawn (three times), because the buffer contains three references to the same object.\nShallow, deep and hybrid copy # Copying a reference to an object can be viewed as the shallowest possible form of copy. As we saw already, this is what happens in Java when a variable with reference type is passed as argument.\nAt the other end of the spectrum is a so-called deep copy, where all attributes of the copied object are duplicated, recursively. In this case, the copy or any object that it references (recursively) can be modified without affecting their original counterparts.\nBetween these two extremes:\na shallow copy creates a new object (with fresh attributes), but does not copy referenced objects recursively, a hybrid copy is anything between a shallow copy and a deep copy. in Java # Copy constructor # A copy can be performed in Java with a so-called copy constructor. This is an additional constructor that takes an instance of the class as input, and returns a copy of this instance.\nFor example:\npublic class Hero { int health; // standard constructor public Hero(){ this.health = 10; } // copy constructor public Hero(Hero original){ this.health = original.health; } } In order to perform a deep(er) copy, a copy constructor may call another copy constructor. For example:\npublic class Snapshot { Hero firstHero; Hero secondHero; Board board; int remainingActions; // standard constructor public Snapshot(Hero firstHero, Hero secondHero, Board board, int remainingActions){ // some code here ... } // copy constructor public Snapshot(Snapshot original){ this.firstHero = new Hero(original.firstHero); this.secondHero = new Hero(original.secondHero); this.board = new Board(original.board); this.remainingActions = original.remainingActions; } } Warning. Similarly to what we saw with the methods toString or equals, beware of recursive implementations of copy constructors, if your program can create an object that refers to itself (directly or indirectly).\nThe method clone # Java also provides a native method called clone to duplicate objects. Like the methods toString and equals that we saw earlier, clone is an instance method of the native Java class Object, which is an (implicit) superclass of every other class.\nOverriding clone can be more concise than using a copy constructor (especially for a class with a large number of attributes).\nWarning. Overriding clone can be error-prone, especially in presence of a class hierarchy (see Effective Java, Item 13 for further insight). Notably, the overriding class must implement the Cloneable interface (even though this interface has not method!), and an implementation of clone usually calls super.clone recursively (even for a class whose only superclass is Object). For these reasons, overriding clone is sometimes discouraged, in favor of conceptually simpler solutions (like copy constructors).\n"},{"id":111,"href":"/docs/env/sections/eval/","title":"Evaluation environment","section":"Development environment","content":" Evaluation environment # The evaluation environment for your project is a virtual machine (with Ubuntu 20) deployed on Microsoft Azure.\nYou are not supposed to develop on this machine, but your project must run in this environment to be evaluated.\nThe first lab provides instructions to use this virtual environment.\n"},{"id":112,"href":"/docs/labs/env/sections/eval/","title":"Evaluation environment","section":"First lab","content":" Evaluation environment # The evaluation environment for your project is a virtual machine (with Ubuntu 20) deployed on Microsoft Azure.

For instance, two real numbers can be compared w.r.t. $\\le$.\nObservation. Some data type have several natural sorting criteria. For instance, strings may be sorted alphabetically from left to right (in English, Hindi, Russian, etc.) or from right to left (in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, etc.).\nQuestion. What about objects, i.e. which sorting criterion can be used to sort a collection of people, cities, sets, lists, trees, etc.?\nAnswer. Any total preorder (i.e. a total, reflexive and transitive binary relation) can be used to sort a collection.\nExercise Which of the following are total preorders (i.e. can be used as a sorting criterion)?\nCompare two real numbers w.r.t. to their absolute value. Compare two people w.r.t. to their age. Compare two people w.r.t. to their age and size, i.e. $\\qquad \\qquad p_1 \\preceq p_2$ iff $\\big(p_1.{\\text{age}} \\le p_2.{\\text{age}}$ and $p_1.{\\text{size}} \\le p_2.{\\text{size}}\\big)$.\nCompare two people w.r.t. to their age or size, i.e. $\\qquad \\qquad p_1 \\preceq p_2$ iff $\\big(p_1.{\\text{age}} \\le p_2.{\\text{age}}$ or $p_1.{\\text{size}} \\le p_2.{\\text{size}}\\big)$.\nCompare two people w.r.t. to their age, and then their size (if they have the same age). Compare two points w.r.t. to their X coordinate, and then their Y coordinate (if they have the same X coordinate). Compare two trees w.r.t. to their number of nodes. Compare two sets w.r.t. to set inclusion. Compare two sets of characters by first sorting each set (by alphabetical order), and then comparing the two resulting sequences lexicographically. Solution is a partial preorder, is not transitive, and is a partial order. The others are total preorders.\nTo see why 4. is not transitive, consider the example:\nPerson Age Height Alice 24 175 Bob 25 160 Carol 21 170 Properties of sorting algorithms # Sorting algorithms have been extensively studied. We will not cover them this semester (with one exception), because this is part of another course of the bachelor.\nWe only highlight some of their properties.\nStability # Definition. A sorting algorithm is stable if it preserves the initial order (in the input collection) of two elements that are equivalent w.r.t. the sorting criterion.\nExample. Consider an array [u1, u2] of type Unit[], where (the objects referenced by) u1 and u2 both have health 2. And let us sort the elements of this array by health.\nA stable sorting algorithm outputs [u1, u2]. A non-stable sorting algorithm may output [u1, u2] or [u2, u1]. In place # Definition. A sorting algorithm is in place if it does not use additional data structures.\nin Java # Comparing # Java provides several native ways to define a sorting criterion (a.k.a. total preorder). We highlight here two of them.\nComparable # A class T can implement the interface Comparable\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;.\nExample. We can create a class City that implements Comparable\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; as follows:\npublic class City implements Comparable\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; { ... } The interface Comparable\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; specifies a single method\nint compareTo (T otherObject); This method should define a total preorder $\\preceq$ over instances of T, as follows.\nLet $o_1$ be the current object (i.e. the instance used to call the method), and let $o_2$ be the other object (i.e. the argument of the method compareTo). Then this method should return:\na negative integer if $o_1 \\prec_o o_2$ (i.e. if $o_1 \\preceq_o o_2$ and $o_2 \\not\\preceq_o o_1$), 0 if $o_1 =_o o_2$ (i.e. if $o_1 \\preceq_o o_2$ and $o_2 \\preceq_o o_1$), a positive integer otherwise. Example (continued). Here is an implementation of the method compareTo where cities are compared by zip code:\npublic class City implements Comparable\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; { public String name; public int zipCode; public City(String name, int zipCode) { this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipCode; } @Override public int compareTo(City otherCity) { return zipCode - otherCity.zipCode; } } Hint. Some native Java classes already implement Comparable, in the expected way. For instance Integer, String (left to right alphabetical order), etc.\nHint. Comparator methods are also available for primitive types (like int, or bool). For instance, Integer has a static method compare(int x, int y) that behaves like compareTo. So the method compareTo in the example above can be simplified as follows:\npublic class City implements Comparable\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; { ... @Override public int compareTo(City otherCity) { return Integer.compare(zipCode, otherCity.zipCode); } } Warning. The method compareTo is implicitly used by some of Java\u0026rsquo;s native data structures (e.g. TreeSet). So it is usually recommended to implement compareTo in such a way that it \u0026ldquo;complies\u0026rdquo; with equals (and hashCode). This means that\n$\\qquad \\qquad $o1.compareTo(o2) should return 0 iff o1.equals(o2) returns true.\nIf you want to use a sorting criterion that does not satisfy this constraint (or if you want to use alternative sorting criteria for the same class), then we recommend using a Comparator instead (explained below).\nComparator # A Comparator in Java is intuitively a total preorder.\nThe Java interface Comparator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; specifies one method that must be implemented by each instance, with signature:\nint compare(T o1, T o2) The return value (negative integer, 0 or positive integer) has the same meaning as the one of Comparable.compareTo.\nExample (continued). We can create another comparator for our class City, which uses the city\u0026rsquo; name rather than zip code.\npublic class CityNameComparator implements Comparator\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; { @Override public int compare(City c1, City c2) { return c1.name.compareTo(c2.name); } } Note. Observe that in this example, we used the instance method compareTo (described above) implemented in the class String.\nThe interface Comparator also provides convenient (default) methods. For instance, the method thenComparing returns the lexicographic product of two comparators.\nSorting # Java provides several methods to sort an array or collection. We highlight here a few of them.\nSorting an array # For an array of type T[], the static method Arrays.sort(T[] array) can be called as follows:\nExample.\nint[] integers = new integer[]{2,1,3,2}; Arrays.sort(integers) // Outputs [1,2,2,3] System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array)); This method sorts the array using the so-called \u0026ldquo;natural ordering\u0026rdquo; for type T. The \u0026ldquo;natural ordering\u0026rdquo; is:\nthe one expected for primitive types (like int), boxed types (like Integer) and a few other native types (like String or Date); a list can be found here, the one defined by T.compareTo if T implements Comparable, underspecified if T is a class that does not implement Comparable. The method Arrays.sort(T[] array, Comparator\u0026lt;? super T\u0026gt; c) is similar, but it uses the input comparator to sort the array.\nExample(continued).\nCity trento = new City(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38121); City bologna = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100); City[] cities = new City[]{trento, bologna}; // After this, the array \u0026#39;cities\u0026#39; contains [bologna, trento] Arrays.sort(cities, new CityNameComparator()); Property. Both methods guarantee stable sorting. For instance:\nCity trento1 = new City(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38122); City bologna = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100); City trento2 = new City(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38121); City[] cities = new City[]{trento1, bologna, trento2}; // After this, the array \u0026#39;cities\u0026#39; contains [bologna, trento1, trento2] Arrays.sort(cities, new CityNameComparator()); Note. For an array with primitive type (like int[]), these two methods use (a version of) the Quicksort algorithm, even though Quicksort is not stable. Stability is irrelevant for these types: for instance, permuting the elements of the array [5,5] yields the same array.\nHowever, for an array with (arbitrary) reference type (like City[]), these methods use (a version of) the MergeSort algorithm, which is stable.\nSorting a list # The class Collections provides a static method Collections.sort(List\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; list), whose behavior is analogous to Arrays.sort. In particular, it also guarantees stable sorting. Like Arrays.sort, it comes in two flavors (with and without comparator).\nExample(continued).\nCity bologna = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100); City trento = new City(\u0026#34;Trento\u0026#34;, 38122); List\u0026lt;City\u0026gt; cities = new LinkedList(); cities.add(bologna); cities.add(trento); // After this, the list \u0026#39;cities\u0026#39; contains [trento, bologna], // due to the way \u0026#39;City\u0026#39; implements \u0026#39;compareTo\u0026#39;. Collections.sort(cities); // After this, the list \u0026#39;cities\u0026#39; contains [bologna, trento], Collections.sort(cities, new CityNameComparator()); The interface List also provides a default method sort that takes a comparator as argument. So in the above example, we could have used:\ncities.sort(new CityNameComparator()); instead of\nCollections.sort(cities, new CityNameComparator()); Usage # Exercise Consider the following class:\npublic class Hero { String name; int health; public Hero(String name, int health){ this.name = name; this.health = health; } } Write a Java method void printHeroesOcc(Hero[] heroes) that takes as input an array of type Hero[], and prints the number of occurrences of each hero in this array, where two heroes are considered identical if they have the same name and health.\nConstraint. For this exercise, you cannot use an associative array (a.k.a. Java Map).\nPossible solution Create a comparator (compare first by health, then by name):\npublic class HeroComparator implements Comparator\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; { @Override public int compare(Hero h1, Hero h2) { int healthComparison = Integer.compare(h1.health, h2.health); return healthComparison != 0 ? healthComparison : h1.name.compareTo(h2.name); } Sort the array and iterate over it to count the number of occurrences of each hero:\nvoid printHeroesOcc(Hero[] heroes) { if (heroes.length == 0) { return; } Comparator\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; comparator = new HeroComparator(); // sort the input array w.r.t. to the comparator Arrays.sort(heroes, comparator); // keeps track of the last hero seen so far Hero previousHero = heroes[0]; // occurrences of the last hero seen so far int occ = 1; // iterate over the array, starting fom the second hero for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt; heroes.length; i++) { // if the current hero and the previous one have the same // name and amount of health if (comparator.compare(previousHero, heroes[i]) == 0) { occ++; } else { printHero(previousHero, occ); previousHero = heroes[i]; occ = 1; } } printHero(previousHero, occ); } private void printHero(Hero hero, int occ) { System.out.println(hero.name + \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; + hero.health + \u0026#34;: \u0026#34; + occ); } Note. The solution to the exercise above relies on sorting the input array. But the same problem could be solved with an associative array, as follows:\noverride equals and hashCode in the class Hero, compute a Map\u0026lt;Hero, Integer\u0026gt; that maps each hero to its number of occurrences in the input array, iterates over the entries of this map and print them. When it comes to running time, the latter solution is more efficient on average (assuming a hash map), but less efficient in the worst case.\n"},{"id":114,"href":"/docs/input/","title":"I/O and serialization","section":"Docs","content":" I/O and serialization # This chapter mostly focuses on Java.\nIt provides (mostly syntactic) information about:\nnavigating or manipulating files and directories, reading from and writing to a file, property files, serializing (and deserializing) a Java object, either natively, or as a JSON object (via Jackson).

The demo below is not meant to be executed with your own terminal. In particular, some software is needed that may not be installed on your computer.\nCreating a static website # As an exercise, we will create a static website, using a simple framework called Hugo.\nFirst, in our home folder, let us create a subfolder dedicated to our projects. For instance, we can call this subfolder workspace. To create this folder, open a terminal and run:\nmkdir workspace Then navigate to this folder with the command cd (you do not need to type the full name of the directory, just type cd w, and press the Tab key for autocompletion):\ncd workspace Next, we will (loosely) follow the quick start tutorial for Hugo. Explanations about some of the command below can be found here.\nCopy-paste the following instruction and press Enter:\nhugo new site mySite This will create a project in a fresh folder called mySite. Let us navigate to it (again, you can take advantage of autocompletion):\ncd mySite Now copy-paste the following commands to declare this folder as a git repository and download a graphical theme for our website:\ngit init git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke echo \u0026#34;theme = \u0026#39;ananke\u0026#39;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; hugo.toml Navigation # At any moment, you can run the command:\npwd to display the current directory. With this command, you can check that you are indeed in the folder mySite.\nTo get a overview of the content of the current folder, run:\nll To get a recursive overview of the content of this folder, run:\ntree In order to navigate to a certain subfolder in this tree, we can take advantage of the fuzzy finder. For instance, let us assume that we want to move to some folder called socials, but we forgot its exact path.\nRun:\nc This will display the paths to all directories in this tree. You can type characters to restrict your search, and use the up down arrow keys to select your destination. For instance, type the three character soc. The best matches are displayed at the bottom of the list. To select one of them, navigate up and down with the arrow keys and press Enter.\nNote. Thanks to fuzzy search, the characters that you type do not need to be contiguous in a path. For instance, when you typed soc, all paths containing these three letters (in that order, but not necessarily contiguous) were retained.\nNow let us navigate back to the mySite folder. Here we can use zoxide, which uses our path navigation history to allow faster navigation. Run:\nzi and then type (the beginning of) mySite.\nSimilarly, to go back to the socials subfolder that we previously went to, run:\nzi again and type (the beginning of) socials.\nAlternatively, you can switch between your current location and the previous one (thanks to zoxide still) with:\nzz Starting the web server # Navigate (back) to the mySite folder (you should know how to do this by now), and run:\nhugo server This will start a local development server for our website. To visualize the site, open Firefox (from the app menu), and use the address displayed in the terminal (it should be http://localhost:1313/)\nTo stop the server (or any Linux process running in a terminal), go back to the terminal an press Ctrl+C.\nNext, we will add content to our website, while keeping the server running.\nTo restart the server, we can use our command history. Type the first letters of the command that we used above to start the serve (e.g. hu). By pressing the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through the commands that you already typed and start with these letters. Scroll until you find the command hugo server, and press Enter to restart the server.\nIn order to keep the server running, we will execute our next command in another terminal. You can create a new one by clicking on the boxed \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon:\nAdding content # Navigate to the (immediate) subfolder content of mysite. Then create a subfolder named posts:\nmkdir posts Navigate to this new folder. Then create a new text file called myPost.md. You can for instance do this with the command:\ngedit myPost.md which will open a new file with this name in the text editor \u0026ldquo;gedit\u0026rdquo;.\nNote. If you only type ge followed by Tab, the shell will suggest you a list of programs whose name starts with these letters. You can scroll through them by pressing Tab again, or add a letter to disambiguate your search.\nIn the text editor, copy-paste the following content:\n+++ title = \u0026#39;My First Post\u0026#39; date = 2024-01-14T07:07:07+01:00 +++ ## Introduction This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text. ### Subsection This is a [link](https://gohugo.io) to the Hugo website. In this file, everything below the header (title/date) is written in Markdown.\nSave the file, and check with Firefox that your first post has been added to your website.\nWarning. To see your changes, you may need to force Firefox to clear its cache: in \u0026ldquo;Settings | Privacy \u0026amp; Security | Cookies and Site Data\u0026rdquo;, click on the \u0026ldquo;Clear Data\u0026rdquo; button.\nIf this does not work, then you can stop and restart the Hugo server, as explained above.\nAliases # The command c that we used above is an alias for a more complex command, namely cd $(find * -type d | fzf)\nWe declared this alias in the file ~/.zshrc (remember that ~ is a shortcut for your home folder).\nLet us open this file to see the declaration of this alias. Navigate to your home folder, for instance with:\ncd And list its content:\nll The file .zshrc should be there. Open this file with gedit:\ngedit .zshrc Note. Again, you can take advantage of autocompletion here. For instance, press ged followed by Tab followed by .z followed by Tab.\nTowards the end of this file, you will see the declaration of the alias:\nalias c=\u0026#39;cd $(find * -type d | fzf)\u0026#39; Let us create another useful alias. Ubuntu has a convenient command called xdg-open that opens a file with the default application associated to this file\u0026rsquo;s extension (this is the equivalent of a double-click in a graphical file browser). Let us set a simpler name than xdg-open to execute this command. For instance o (like \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;).\nFirst, let us check that the name o is not used already for another command. Open a new terminal and run:\no You should get a \u0026ldquo;command not found\u0026rdquo; message, which confirms that this command is free.\nNow let us add the following line to the .zshrc file:\nalias o=\u0026#39;xdg-open\u0026#39; Save the file and open a new terminal.\nYou can now use the o command to open any file.\nTo see this, let us navigate back to the socials folder that we were previously in (e.g. using zi, as explained above). If you list the files in this folder (with ll), then you will see that they have the .svg extension. To open one of these files, you can type o and the first letters of the name of the file, then Tab for autocompletion. This will open the file with the default image viewer application on this machine.\nScripts # If you want to use an alias to execute a (possibly complex) sequence of commands, then the preferred way is to write a script.\nFor instance, we could write a script that navigates to the mySite folder and then starts the hugo server. And we may use the alias ws (like \u0026ldquo;website\u0026rdquo;) to call this script (you can check that it is free).\nNavigate to the ~/bin folder, and create a text file called ws (for instance with gedit, as we did above for the post).\nIn this file, copy-paste the following:\n#! /bin/bash cd ~/workspace/mySite hugo server start Observe that these are the two instructions for the two tasks that we want to execute. Save the file, and make it executable by running:\nsudo chmod u+x ws To test your script, close all running instances of hugo (if any), e.g. with Ctrl + C, as explained above.\nNow regardless of your location, you can type ws to start the web server.\nNote. Linux shells (such as bash or zsh) support the same language for commands and scripts. This is a full-fledged programming language (with conditional statements, loops, etc.), where an instruction can also be a command.\nTerminal-based applications # To conclude the demo, we introduce a few convenient applications that run in a terminal. These may save you time (compared to similar applications that rely on a GUI).\nripgrep # ripgrep allows you to search files that contain certain words or regular expressions (your IDE offers a similar functionality). For instance, let us assume that we want to search for all files under mySite that contain the string \u0026ldquo;Canada\u0026rdquo;.\nNavigate to the mySite folder. Then run:\nrg Canada This will display the path to each (text) file that contains this word (in this example, there is only one match), and the corresponding line numbers.\nranger # ranger is a popular terminal-based file browser.\nTo open it, type:\nranger You can navigate within the current directory with the up and down arrow keys, and in the directory tree (from child to parent and conversely) with the left and right arrow keys. Note that it also displays previews of text files.\nTo quit ranger, you can press the letter q.\nhtop # htop allows you to monitor processes running on your machine. To open it, type:\nhtop The upper part of the interface displays memory and CPU usage, whereas the lower part displays running process (sorted by CPU usage by default). You can kill a process with F9.\nTo quit htop, you can press the letter q.\nncdu # ncdu allows you to visualize the amount of disk space taken by your files and programs.\nTo open it, type:\nncdu The folders and files in the current folder are sorted by disk space, and you can navigate the directory tree using the arrow keys (like with ranger).\nTo quit ranger, you can press the letter q.\n"},{"id":117,"href":"/docs/lambda/","title":"First-class methods","section":"Docs","content":" First-class methods # Over the years, imperative languages (like Python, JavaScript, C#, C++, Java, etc.) have incorporated features borrowed from functional programming.\nJava 8 (2014) was an important step in this direction, notably with the introduction of lambda expressions, often used in combination with streams.\n"},{"id":118,"href":"/docs/objects/sections/encapsulation/","title":"Encapsulation","section":"Objects and classes","content":" Encapsulation # Encapsulation is a (vague) principle in object-oriented programming that refers to \u0026ldquo;bundling\u0026rdquo; data with the code that operates on it, and restrict access to this code and data from other components of a system.\nFrom Wikipedia: \u0026ldquo;Essentially, encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rdquo;\nEach component hides its internal logic by exposing only data and methods that other components may need.\nExample. As we saw earlier, in our game, the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component (which is in charge of rendering the game on screen) may buffer the game snapshots that it receives from the backend, if these snapshots are received faster than they can be displayed.\nAs a buffer, this component uses a structure called a queue. This queue is not exposed to other components, because they do not need to see it, and (most importantly) should not modify it. In other words, this queue is an implementation detail, internal to the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component.\nEncapsulation can have many benefits. Among others:\nEasier debugging. If our queue is internal to the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component, then we know that it cannot be responsible for the malfunction of another component. Easier collaboration. Carol may refactor the implementation of the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component, knowing that this will not affect Alice, who is currently working on the backend. This is why a common practice in object-oriented programming consists in hiding all attributes and methods of a new class by default. And make accessible only the ones that need to be (in particular, this is likely to be the default behavior of your IDE).\nEncapsulation also largely dictates how libraries are structured. For instance, when you create a String in Java, you do not have access to the internal representation of the string object.\nin Java # Each attribute or method of a class can have an access modifier, which specifies which other classes can access it. For instance, the keywords private and protected below are access modifiers.\nprivate int myAttribute; protected int myMethod(){ return 1; } Definition. There are four levels of access in Java:\nprivate restricts access to the current class, \u0026ldquo;package-private\u0026rdquo; relaxes private by also allowing access from the folder of the current class (in Java, a folder for source code is called a package), excluding subfolders, protected relaxes \u0026ldquo;package-private\u0026rdquo; by also allowing access from the subclasses of the current class, public does not restrict access. Warning. There is no keyword for the \u0026ldquo;package-private\u0026rdquo; level. Instead, this is the default level for an attribute or method without access modifier. For instance, in the example below, the attribute myAttribute is package-private:\nint myAttribute; Here is a recap table from the Oracle tutorials:\nkeyword class package subclasses world private yes no no no none yes yes no no protected yes yes yes no public yes yes yes yes Warning. A method declared in an interface is (implicitly) public.\nWarning. If a method m1 overrides (or implements) a method m2, then m1 must be at least as accessible as m2.\nExercise The following program does not compile. Can you see why, and how to fix this?\n├── Run.java └── units ├── Unit.java └── impl └── Unicorn.java public abstract class Unit { static String configFolder = \u0026#34;path/to/config\u0026#34;; } public class Unicorn extends Unit { String name; public Unicorn (String name){ this.name = name; } public static String getConfigFilePath (){ return configFolder + \u0026#34;/unicorn.properties\u0026#34;; } } public class Run { void testUnicorn(){ Unicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;Storm\u0026#34;); myUnicorn.name = \u0026#34;Tornado\u0026#34;; } } Solution Unicorn.getConfigFilePath tries to access the package-private attribute Unit.configFolder (it should be made protected of public), Run.getConfigFilePath, tries to access the package-private attribute name of myUnicorn (it should be made public). Hint. Your IDE may suggest how to fix such compilation errors.\nTo improve encapsulation, it is good practice to restrict access whenever possible (i.e. without compromising compilation).\nHint. As a rule of thumb, in Java:\nuse private by default for all attributes and methods that you create, and if the program does not compile, then use your IDE to relax access. Exercise Encapsulation in this program can be improved. Can you see how?\n├── Run.java └── units ├── Unit.java └── impl └── Unicorn.java public abstract class Unit { public int health; public Unit(int health) { this.health = health; } public void attack(Unit defender){ health -= defender.health; defender.health = -health; } } public class Unicorn extends Unit { public Unicorn (){ super(1); } @Override public void attack(Unit defender){ regen(); super.attack(defender); } public void regen(){ health += 1; } } public class Run { void testUnicorn(){ Unicorn u1 = new Unicorn(); Unicorn u2 = new Unicorn(); u1.attack(u2); } } Solution Unit.health can be made protected, the constructor of Unit can be made protected, Unit.attack can be made protected, Unicorn.regen can be made private. Note. The constructor of an abstract class can always be made protected (since it can only be called in the constructor of a subclass).\nGetters and setters # For attributes, the notion of \u0026ldquo;access\u0026rdquo; can be refined. An attribute may be:\nneither visible nor modifiable, or only visible, or only modifiable, or both visible and modifiable. This can be achieved with private attributes and so-called \u0026ldquo;getter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;setter\u0026rdquo; methods. For instance, in the following class, the attribute health has public visibility but is not modifiable.\npublic class Unicorn { private int health; public int getHealth(){ return health; } } Conversely, in the following class, the attribute health can be modified but is not visible.\npublic class Butterfly { private int health; public void setHealth(int health){ this.health = health; } } Hint. Getter and setter methods can be automatically generated by your IDE.\nTo go further: inheritance and encapsulation # Composition # Example (from Effective Java, Item 18).\nConsider a class MyHashSet that extends Java\u0026rsquo;s HashSet functionalities by keeping track of the number of times something has been added to the set (as opposed to the output of HashSet.size(), which returns the number of elements remaining in the set).\nThis class myHashSet may have a private attribute int counter (initialized to 0) that keeps track of the number of elements added to the set so far. And the class may be implemented by overriding add and addAll in the expected way, i.e.:\npublic class MyHashSet extends HashSet { private int counter; ... @Override public boolean add(E e){ counter++; return super.add(e); } @Override public boolean addAll(Collection\u0026lt;? extends E\u0026gt; c){ counter += c.size(); return super.addAll(c); } } However, this implementation of addAll would count every insertion twice, because the implementation of HashSet.addAll calls the method add (which is overridden in this case).\nA design pattern called composition can be used to avoid such unintended effects. Intuitively, instead of extending the original class, use an instance of the original class as a (private) attribute of the new class (e.g. an instance Hashset named set in this example). However, this requires re-implementing all methods of the original class (albeit in a straightforward way), for instance:\npublic class MyHashSet { public boolean isEmpty(){ return set.isEmpty(); } } Prevent overriding or inheritance # As show by the example above, in order to improve encapsulation, one may want in some scenarios to forbid overriding a method or extending a class. In Java, this can be enforced with the keyword final, for instance:\npublic final class NonExtensibleClass { ... } public class MyClass{ public final void nonOverridableMethod(){ ... } } Warning. In Java, a variable can also be declared final. But this has a different meaning.\n"},{"id":119,"href":"/docs/stream/","title":"Streams in Java","section":"Docs","content":" Streams in Java # A Java stream is a sequence of objects.\nWhen it is finite, a stream may be viewed as a list with limitations: a stream can only be iterated over, from left to right, and only once (this is called consuming a stream).\nStream vs Collection # The Javadoc for the package java.util.stream summarizes key differences between a Java Stream and a Java Collection (like a List):\nNo storage. A stream is not a data structure that stores elements; instead, it conveys elements from a source (such as an array) through a pipeline of computational operations. Functional in nature. An operation on a stream produces a result, but does not modify its source. For example, filtering a stream obtained from a collection produces a new stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection. Laziness-seeking. Many stream operations, such as filtering, mapping, or duplicate removal, can be implemented lazily, exposing opportunities for optimization. Possibly unbounded.

However, these two values (or at least the value of the attribute id) are unlikely to change.\nIn Java (or C#, C++, etc.), it is possible to forbid these two values to be modified. This would have prevented compilation of the incorrect program above.\nImmutable object # Informally, an object is mutable if it can be modified after its creation.\nImmutability has many known benefits (but also drawbacks):\nBenefits # Easier debugging: as illustrated above, forcing an object to be immutable may prevent an incorrect program to compile. Compile-time errors are usually easier to fix that bugs. Readability: code that modifies or reuses objects can be harder to understand (and reason about) than code that creates (fresh) immutable objects. Thread-safety: multiple threads can access an immutable object concurrently without race condition. Easier collaboration and maintenance: Alice can safely pass an immutable object to Bob (i.e. make the object visible to Bob\u0026rsquo;s code). This will not affect the correctness of Alice\u0026rsquo;s code (because Bob\u0026rsquo;s code cannot modify this object). Reference. For a more in-depth analysis of the benefits of immutability, we refer to Effective Java, item 17:\n\u0026ldquo;Classes should be immutable unless there\u0026rsquo;s a very good reason to make them mutable.\u0026rdquo;\nObservation. Some programming language (like Haskell or Rust), enforce (a form of) immutability by default.\nDrawbacks # Performance: on a large scale (e.g. thousands of objects), reusing existing object may be more efficient that creating (fresh) immutable ones. Terminology # The term \u0026ldquo;immutable object\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;immutable class\u0026rdquo;) is used with slightly different meanings. In particular:\na weaker notion of immutability only requires the attributes of an object to be non-modifiable, a stronger notion also requires the objects that are referred to (transitively) to be non-modifiable. By convention, we will use in what follows the term \u0026ldquo;final\u0026rdquo; for the weaker requirement, and \u0026ldquo;immutable\u0026rdquo; for the stronger requirement. More precisely:\nDefinition. An object is final if its attributes cannot be modified after the object\u0026rsquo;s creation.\nDefinition. An object is immutable if it is final and the other objects that it references are immutable.\nin Java # final # The Java keyword final ensures that a variable cannot change value after its initialization.\nExample. The following Java program does not compile.\nfinal int a = 2; a = 3; Warning. This meaning of the keyword final is different from that we already saw in the section on encapsulation.\nWhen the variable is an instance attribute, this also forces the attributes to be explicitly instantiated before the execution of the constructor terminates.\nExample. The following Java program does not compile.\npublic class User { final int id; final String name; public User(int id){ this.id = id; } } Example. The following Java program compiles, and the instances of User are immutable (because strings in Java are themselves immutable).\npublic class User { final int id; final String name; public User(int id, String name){ this.id = id; this.name = name; } } Note. Alternatively, a final instance attribute can be instantiated immediately after it is declared (because this instruction is executed before the constructor). For instance, the following program compiles.\npublic class User { public final int id; public final String name = \u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;; public User(int id){ this.id = id; } } In practice. Your IDE is likely to create final (and private) instance attributes by default.\nfinal vs immutable # Warning. The final keyword may not be sufficient to enforce immutability (at least as it is defined above), in particular when a final attribute refers to a mutable object.\nExample. Instances of the class User below are final, but not immutable, because instances of Address are not immutable.\npublic class User { final int id; final Address address; public User(int id, Address address){ this.id = id; this.address = address; } } public class Address { int streetNumber; String street; int zipCode; public Address(int streetNumber, String street, int zipCode){ this.streetNumber = streetNumber; this.street = street; this.zipCode = zipCode; } } For instance, the following code compiles.\nAddress myAddress = new Address(14, \u0026#34;via Goethe\u0026#34;, 39100); User myUser = new User(1, myAddress); myAddress.streetNumber = 12; Final and immutable types # We already encountered several types of Java object and quasi-objects that are:\nfinal: records, sets (resp. lists, maps) that are declared with Set.of() (resp. List.of(), Map.of()), immutable: strings, boxed types (like Integer or Boolean). Record # A record is final.\nExamples. Because strings are immutable, the following records are immutable:\nrecord User(int id, String name){}; However, the following records are only final (unless instance of Address are immutable):\nrecord User(int id, String name, Address address){}; Set, List, Map # If a set (resp. list, map) is created with Set.of() (resp. List.of(), Map.of()), then its content is final.\nExample. The following Java program throws an UnsupportedOperation exception.\nSet\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; mySet = Set.of(2, 3); mySet.add(5); However, if the set (resp. list, map) contains references, then the objects that are referred to may be mutable.\nExample. The following program compiles (assuming that the attribute streetNumber of the class Address does not have the final keyword).\nAddress myAddress = new Address(14, \u0026#34;via Goethe\u0026#34;, 39100); Set\u0026lt;Address\u0026gt; mySet = Set.of(myAddress); myAddress.streetNumber = 12; By design, most other implementations of List, Set and Map are not final (this is expected, for performance reasons).\nHowever, in some scenarios, a program may create a (small) list (resp. set, map) that is not meant to be modified. For instance, the list of all files in a folder. In this case, the list (resp. set, map) can be made final. A common way to achieve this is the class ImmutableList (resp. ImmutableSet, ImmutableMap) of the Guava library.\nTo use Guava in a Maven project, declare this dependency:\n\u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.google.guava\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;guava\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;33.1.0-jre\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/dependencies\u0026gt; or in a Gradle project:\nimplementation group: \u0026#39;com.google.guava\u0026#39;, name: \u0026#39;guava\u0026#39;, version: \u0026#39;33.1.0-jre\u0026#39; String # Java\u0026rsquo;s strings are immutable.\nHowever, the class StringBuilder implements a mutable string. It provides instance methods like append, insert, delete (a substring), etc.\nBoxed types # Java\u0026rsquo;s boxed types (like Integer or Boolean) are immutable.\nHowever, each boxed types has a mutable \u0026ldquo;atomic\u0026rdquo; counterpart, e.g. AtomicInteger for Integer and AtomicBoolean for Boolean.\nThe main purpose of these classes is to offer build-in thread safety for common sequences of operations. For instance, AtomicInteger provides a method equivalent to i++, but thread-safe (note that i++ is a shortcut for three operations: read the value, increment it and write it back).\nExercise What does the following program output?\nBoolean b = true; // Create an atomic boolean with value true AtomicBoolean ab = new AtomicBoolean(true); List\u0026lt;Boolean\u0026gt; booleans = new LinkedList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); List\u0026lt;AtomicBoolean\u0026gt; aBooleans = new LinkedList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); booleans.add(b); aBooleans.add(ab); b = false; // Set the value of the atomic boolean to false ab.set(false); booleans.add(b); aBooleans.add(ab); System.out.println(booleans); System.out.println(aBooleans); Solution [true, false] [false, false] "},{"id":123,"href":"/docs/multithreading/","title":"Multithreading","section":"Docs","content":" Multithreading # A variety of programming languages (like Java) allow associating a computational task to a thread, and executing several threads in parallel (on different cores) or concurrently (on the same core, in an interleaved fashion).\nA consequence is that the precise order in which threads execute their respective operations can be unpredictable.\nWhen threads need to communicate, this can result in a program whose behavior is difficult to understand.

Common categories are:\nfunctional vs non-functional test unit vs integration test security test performance test regression test etc. A test can help developers clarify what a program (resp. component, method) is expected to do. So in a sense, tests are part of the documentation or specification of a system, because they provide precise examples of the expected behavior of the program (resp. component, method).\nThis is why tests are often part of the development process itself. Notably, test-driven development consists in developing tests cases before software is fully developed.\nUnit tests # A unit test is usually understood as:\ntesting the behavior of a small piece of code (typically a method), automated (typically integrated to the build process), fast. Besides, most unit tests are concerned with correctness (rather than performance for instance).\nWarning. The tests used to evaluate assignments in this course are implemented via libraries for unit testing. However, many of them do not qualify as unit tests.\nIn its simplest form, a unit test can be viewed as a pair\n$\\qquad$ (input, expected output)\nfor a given computational problem.\nExample. Consider the following problem:\nInput: a (finite) array of positive integers, representing the successive values of a stock, one value per day.\nOutput: the maximal gain that can be made by buying on a certain day, and selling the same day or later on.\nPossible unit tests for this problem are:\n( [0, 3], 3 ) ( [4, 3, 6, 8, 6], 5 ) ( [2, 4, 9, 1, 3], 7 ) ( [3, 2], 0 ) etc. Exercise Consider the following problem:\nInput: a (finite) array of characters, with possibly duplicated characters (and no restriction on the size of the array).\nOutput: the size of the longest (left-to-right) sequence in this array that respects alphabetical order.\nFor instance, for the input\n$\\qquad$ [m, q, b, e, e, z, m, e],\nthe expected output is 4.\nQuestion. Does there exist a (finite) set of unit tests for this problem that guarantees that an implementation is correct?\nSolution No.\nFor any (finite) set of unit tests (for this problem), there exists an algorithm that passes the tests but is incorrect.\nTo demonstrate this, observe that a unit tests for this problem is a pair $(a, i)$, where\n$a$ is an array of characters, and $i$ is a natural number. Take any finite set\n$\\qquad (a_1, i_1), (a_2, i_2),\\ ..,\\ (a_n, i_n)$\nof such unit tests.\nBecause this set is finite, there exists an array of characters $a_0$ that does not appear in this set of tests.\nLet $i_0$ be the expected output for $a_0$, and let $j$ be any positive integer different from $i_0$.\nNow consider the method (in pseudocode):\nint sizeOfLongestNonDecreasingSequence(char[] characters) { if(characters == a_1) { return i_1 } if(characters == a_2) { return i_2 } ... if(characters == a_n) { return i_n } return j; } This algorithm will pass the unit tests, but is incorrect for the input $a_0$.\nThis (artificial) exercise was only meant to illustrate the following:\nWarning. In general, no (reasonably small) set of unit tests can ensure that a (non-trivial) method is correct.\nUnit test design # Here are a few simple rules of thumb to design unit tests.\nThe input for a unit test is usually small (this makes debugging easier when the test fails).\nTwo tests for the same method should illustrate different types of inputs/scenarios (writing similar tests is a waste of time).\nTrivial methods do not need unit tests.\nPriority is often given to so-called \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; tests (a.k.a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; scenarios). These are representative of what the tested method is likely to receive as input.\nIn addition to \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; tests, one may implement tests that deal with corner cases (e.g. empty array, value 0, etc.). However, an exhaustive coverage of corner cases is often unnecessary, because the methods that call the tested method cannot produce such inputs.\nA unit test should be reproducible. In particular, it should not depend on:\n(pseudo)-random values, external services (web API, etc.) whose behavior cannot be controlled. Implementation # Requirement. A unit test should itself be free of bugs.\nFor this reason, unit tests usually:\nrely of widely used libraries for test execution, mostly consist of simple, declarative code otherwise. In particular, unit tests are a (rare) case where code factorization is not a priority (i.e. unit tests may contain redundant code).\nUnit tests and build automation # Unit tests are usually integrated to the standard build automation process of a project.\nFor instance, the test-compile and test phases of Maven\u0026rsquo;s default lifecycle are in charge of compiling and executing unit tests respectively. This effectively prevents further phases to be executed if a test fails.\nRegression tests # A regression test is meant to verify that modifications brought to the code base (e.g. a new feature, code optimization, reorganization, etc. ) do not compromise correctness of functionalities that were already implemented.\nSome unit tests may act in practice as regression tests.\nIn particular, before sharing code with co-developers (e.g. via the main branch of a git repository), it is good practice to verify that all unit tests as successful.\nExercise (reminder) Consider a basic collaboration scheme via git, where:\nAlice, Bob and Carol collaborate on the same project, they share code via the main branch, each of them has a personal branch (named alice, bob and carol respectively) where they write code that is not yet ready to be shared with the others. Alice just finished implementing a method, on the branch alice. Her code compiles and passes all unit tests. Now she wants to share her code with the other two.\nWhich sequence of git commands should Alice execute?\nSolution Commit her changes (locally, to the branch alice): git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;commit message\u0026quot; Update the remote copy of the branch alice (for backup only): git push Synchronize the local copy of the branch main (because Bob and Carol may have added content to it): git checkout main git pull Merge (locally) the content of main into alice (and fix the merge conflicts, if any): git checkout alice git merge main Merge (locally) the content of alice into main (there should be no more conflict). After this step, the local copies of alice and main will be identical. git checkout main git merge alice Upload the changes: git push Go back to work: git checkout alice "},{"id":127,"href":"/docs/simplify/","title":"Simplifying code","section":"Docs","content":" Simplifying code # In this chapter, we focus on a few low-level, mechanical practices that can help writing more readable or maintainable code.\nThis complements the chapter dedicated to unit tests, which discusses the benefits of decomposing complex methods (or problems) into smaller ones.\n"},{"id":128,"href":"/docs/env/","title":"Development environment","section":"Docs","content":" Development environment # As a developer, you will interact with a computer in ways that you may not be used to.

For instance, 93.87% of respondents to the 2022 Stack overflow survey declared using it.\nGit allows synchronizing the content of a directory (called a repository) across several machines. Notably:\neach machine contains a copy of the repository and its full history, git allows parallel histories to coexist (in so-called branches), and provides ways to reconcile them. Warning. Git is not suited to large datasets (more than 1 GB).\nScope of this chapter # Git has almost 150 commands, each of which may be called with multiple options. But in practice, most users use a handful of these commands on a regular basis.\nThis chapter only provides a basic introduction and a minimal set of commands, which you are likely to need during the development of you project. Additional resources can be found here.\nTerminology # A difficulty when discovering with git may be it terminology. Here is a very approximative map from git concepts to terms that you are familiar with:\nGlossary.\na repository: a directory (more exactly, the root directory of a project) a remote server: a non-local server (typically on the cloud) to clone: to copy (a repository) to commit: to save to push: to upload (to a remote server) to fetch: to download (from a remote server) a branch: an alternative history (in your favorite time-travel novel/series/movie) to merge: to reconcile two branches CLI or GUI # Many Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are available for git, and many programs (e.g. probably your IDE) provide some form of git integration.\nHowever, git is mostly used (and almost exclusively taught) via its Command Line Interface (CLI). In addition, the documentation and help that you may find online overwhelmingly relies on its CLI.\nPossible explanations are efficiency (autocompletion, aliases, scripts, etc.), transparency, reproducibility, stability over time, etc.\nIf you use git via CLI, then we recommend using a modern shell for command autocompletion.\nIf you want a flavor of how a terminal can be configured (for git and other purposes), then you can follow the demo of the first lab.\nHosting service # To collaborate via git and/or back up your repositories, you need to use a git hosting service.\nPopular options are GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket.\nThe Unibz also offers a self-hosted Gitlab service.\n"},{"id":130,"href":"/docs/build/","title":"Build automation","section":"Docs","content":" Build automation # Building a piece of software means converting source code into a program that can be executed.\nBuilding a program may consists of many subtasks:\ngenerating code, compilation, linking, unit tests, file compression, generating documentation, creating an executable or an installer, integration tests, deployment, etc. Each of these subtasks may be performed numerous times during the development of a program. So it is natural to automate the build.\nA build automation tool is meant to facilitate the configuration of these tasks, and execute them automatically, typically as (one or several) \u0026ldquo;pipeline(s)\u0026rdquo;.\nFor instance, Maven is a build automation tool for Java. A Maven project is often build with a single command:\nmvn package Other popular build automation tools include:\nMake, CMake or Ninja for C/C++, MSBuild for C#, Grunt or Gulp for Javascript, Gradle (multi-language), sbt for scala etc. Note. Some subtasks of a build may be performed on a server (e.g. each time a developer pushes a git branch), as part of a process called continuous integration (CI). Popular frameworks to set up a CI server include Jenkins and Travis CI. CI is beyond the scope of this course.\nin Java: Maven vs Gradle # The two most popular build automation tools for Java are Maven and Gradle.\nBoth also act as package managers for Java libraries.\nMaven is slightly older (2004 vs 2008), and influenced the design of Gradle.\nMaven # Maven is (still?) more widely used than Gradle. It also has a gentler learning curve.\nIn particular, Maven relies on a number of implicit conventions (e.g. for directory layout). For a simple project, this often results in a quicker set up than with Gradle (but makes advanced customization more involved).\nDue to the popularity of Maven, some of these conventions (e.g. directory layout and artifact naming) have also been adopted in other contexts.\nAdditional strengths of Maven are:\nexcellent integration with IDEs, a vast ecosystem of plugins. A common criticism of Maven is the use of XML files to specify a project\u0026rsquo;s build, which can be verbose and difficult to parse (for a human being).\nIn this course. For simplicity, this chapter (mostly) focuses on Maven. In addition, the content is restricted to the bare minimum (i.e. what you are likely to need for your project).\nFor a more thorough introduction to Maven, a good entry point is the official getting started guide.\nGradle # Gradle is a multi-language build automation tool. Among others, it offers support for project written in Java and its main derivatives (Groovy, Kotlin and Scala), C/C++ and Javascript. Gradle has been selected by Google as the official build automation tool for Android applications.\nGradle has a more concise syntax than Maven (precisely two: one is a Groovy Domain Specific Language (DSL), the other is a Kotlin DSL). Re-building a project can also be faster with Gradle than than with Maven, thanks to more advanced caching strategies. Another strength of Gradle is its flexibility : a build can be easily customized, whereas Maven relies on conventions that can be hard to bypass.\nGradle is often considered more difficult to learn than Maven, especially for new programmers. Its syntax is also less stable (older project configurations need to be updated to comply with more recent releases).\nNote. If you chose the board game as your project, then you will use Gradle (at least by default).\nThe build is already configured. By default, you do not need to modify it, except maybe to declare dependencies.\n"},{"id":131,"href":"/docs/background/","title":"Background","section":"Docs","content":" Background # This chapter gathers basic notions that are used throughout other chapters.\n"},{"id":132,"href":"/docs/git/sections/ignore/","title":"Ignore","section":"Git","content":"\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash; weight: 10 title: \u0026ldquo;Ignoring files\u0026rdquo; draft: false\nIgnoring files # You can add a file named .gitignore to the root folder of your repository.\nIt specifies files that cannot be staged.\nThis is commonly used to exclude from a repository:\ncompiled code (e.g. files with the extension .class in Java), dependencies (e.g. the content of the /node_modules folder in a Node.js project), IDE-generated files (e.g. the .idea/ folder for IntelliJ), OS-generated files (e.g. .DS_Store/ folders for macOS), etc. The .gitignore file uses a dedicated syntax to specify which files should be excluded.\nFor instance the pattern *.class excludes all files with the extension .class.\nHere is a quick tutorial about the syntax of .gitignore files.\nThis repository also contains a large collection of .gitignore patterns, for different programming languages, operating systems, programs, etc. For instance Java, Maven, VSCode, IntelliJ, Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.\n"},{"id":133,"href":"/docs/labs/env/","title":"First lab","section":"Docs","content":" First lab: working environment # Terminal and text editor Shell autocompletion Installing software with a package manager ssh key Default text editor for git Evaluation environment Using a terminal (demo) "}]
