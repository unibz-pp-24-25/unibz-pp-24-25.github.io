Students who collaborate on the same group project are expected to attend the same lab.\nMost labs will be dedicated to the assignments for this course. Two labs will be dedicated to a presentation and discussion of the advancement of the group projects.\nTimetable # Some weeks will see fewer lectures/labs, and schedules or room numbers may vary from one week to the other. So make sure to check the timetable.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/intro/","title":"This course","section":"Docs","content":" Structure and organization of the course # This chapter explains how the course is structured and provides a brief overview of its content.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/intro/sections/lecturers/","title":"Teaching staff","section":"This course","content":" Teaching staff # Julien Corman will teach the lectures and one lab.\nDjamila Oukharijane will teach the other lab.\nOffice hours # If you need additional help with the content of the course, the assignments and/or your project, you can ask for office hours with any (or both) of us.\nThese appointments must be scheduled via email (follow the links above for our email addresses).\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/intro/sections/evaluation/","title":"Evaluation","section":"This course","content":" Evaluation # Evaluation for this course is based on:\nassignments: up to 30 points, a group project: up to 60 points, and an oral exam: up to 10 points. Your final grade is the sum of the above, multiplied by 0.3.\nAssignments # There will be 7 or 8 assignments for this course. These are standard programming exercises, related to notions seen during the lectures. The labs are (mostly) dedicated to these assignments.\nThe assignments are individual (do not submit the code of another student).\nThe release of each assignment is announced via Teams.\nAssignments are submitted via GitHub classroom. You can submit an assignment multiple times (but only before its deadline).\nNote. In order to submit your assignments (and your project), you will need a GitHub account. If you do not have one already, please create one and communicate it to the lecturer, preferably via Teams. Make sure that you use a single GitHub account for all your assignments and your project.\nGroup project # Guidelines for the content of the project are in the dedicated chapter. We focus here on organization and evaluation.\nEach group must consist of 3 to 4 students. Groups should be decided by March 20, and communicated via mail or Teams to the lecturer.\nProjects are delivered via GitHub.\nThe project\u0026rsquo;s code is expected to apply techniques seen during the lectures, but only if relevant. Please do not add artificial functionalities to your project for the sole purpose of illustrating a certain technique.\nGrades for a project are awarded individually, based on each student\u0026rsquo;s contribution. Students are expected to work on different computers. Make sure that:\neach student uses a different (and only one) GitHub account, and each student commits (via git) his/her own code. Among other evaluation criteria, we consider:\nquantity of work, non-trivial logic, appropriate data types and data structures, structure of the code (no code duplication, good usage of methods, classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc.) readability, documentation, naming, collaboration, integration with the rest of project, evidence of testing, etc. Oral exam # The oral exam is individual.\nNo revision is needed.\nWe will ask you questions about your code and/or involvement in the project.\nFor instance:\nwhich design choices you made, which difficulties you encountered, the expected behavior of a certain method, how some portions of the code may be improved, etc. In particular, we will check whether you have a good understanding of the code that you submitted. If not, then your mark for the project may be reevaluated.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/objects/","title":"Objects and classes","section":"Docs","content":" Objects and classes # This chapter introduces some basic notions of (class-based) object-oriented programming.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/intro/sections/bibliography/","title":"Additional resources","section":"This course","content":" Additional resources # You can use additional resource to solve the assignments or develop your project: web sites, IDE generated code, Copilot, et. However, make sure that you understand the code that you submit.\nJava\u0026rsquo;s syntax # This website contains Java code snippets that illustrate how to perform certain operations. However, this documentation is far from exhaustive (on purpose).\nWhen it comes to syntax, the first two sources of complementary material for this course are:\nthe Javadoc of the libraries (standard and auxiliary) used in projects and assignments. An IDE is often the fastest way to navigate through it, the web. Books # An (optional) reading list for this course is available in the catalogue of the Unibz\u0026rsquo;s library. All books can be accessed via the library (either physically or digitally).\nAmong these books, we highlight the following three:\nIntroductory textbooks # Java : the complete reference (11th edition) by Herbert Schildt McGraw-Hill Education, 2019\nThis is a general introductory book to Java and object oriented programming. It covers most of the topics seen in this course (and a lot more).\nHead First Java (3rd edition) by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates and Trisha Gee O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Media, 2022\nThis is an alternative introductory book, less comprehensive, but with a larger emphasis on problem solving (rather than syntax).\nGood practices (intermediate level) # Effective Java (3rd edition)\nby Joshua Bloch\nAddison-Wesley Professional, 2017\nThis is a reference book for best practices and common pitfalls when programming in Java.\n"}]
